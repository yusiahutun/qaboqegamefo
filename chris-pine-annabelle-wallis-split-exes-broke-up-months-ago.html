She added that Pine “didn’t really like to go out to clubs or anything like that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Patridge, as a reality TV star, was constantly going on public outings and getting photographed. “He didn’t like the whole paparazzi side of it,” she explained. “That was my life, was going out, and I was followed by paparazzi.”</p><p>The actor previously gave some insight into what he does like in a potential partner <a href=#>during an appearance</a> on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2013. “Intelligence, beauty, and a sense of humor,” he said of qualities he wants in a girlfriend. “Well, I think you have to be able to carry on a conversation, after the initial attraction, after the lust dies down; there has to be the thing that engages you. And that is intelligence and humor.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoKKewG68yKecZpmeo66jsculnGavkaG5qr%2BMrKeloaRisrmx0maZq6ebmnq2vIympqesmKh6orPOaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
