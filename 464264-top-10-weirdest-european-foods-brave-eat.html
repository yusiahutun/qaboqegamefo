One of the things that might take you by surprise are the weirdest European foods. So, do you know any of these foods?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fc67c0d5bfa69480.png><p class=align-left>You may have probably heard stories about European eating the weirdest delicacy. If yes, have you asked yourself whether it is true or false, or which kind of food they are? There are several unusual European foods to consider and perhaps dig into if you are curious.</p><h2>Weird eastern European food</h2><p class=align-left>Different<a href=#> continents have dishes</a> that distinguish them from others, and Europe is no exception. When you talk about European cuisine, most people think of rich comfort foods. However, as in the case with many other cuisines, even the Europeans have a good number of weird foods. Here is a list of some gross European foods only the brave can eat.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0088de6416b2581c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 10 tastiest fish in the world that you should try out</span></p></a><h3>1. Maggots cheese</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0088de6416b2581c.jpg><p class=align-left>Maggot cheese, also known as casu marzu, is a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">traditional Sardinian sheep</a> milk cheese that contains live insect larvae or maggots. Casu marzu is made by going beyond the standard phase of fermentation until the cheese is dissolved, starting with the manufacture of Pecorino cheese.</p><p class=align-left>The pecorino cheese is usually left outside for flies to deposit their eggs in it. Once the eggs open, the maggots larvae start feeding on the cheese, and the cheese is ready. Unfortunately, the Piophilidae cheese fly larvae are reintroduced to the cheese after it has decomposed, rendering it unsafe to consume.</p><p class=align-left>Even though European Union food relegations have officially made casu marzu (maggot cheese) illegal, it is still available on the black market, where it may be sold for double the original price.</p><h3>2. Frog legs</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/454e43e0484c1316.jpg><p class=align-left>They are one of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">renowned delicacies </a>of French cuisine, and it has been considered a national delicacy. Frog legs are very nutritious as they are rich in protein, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin A, and potassium. They are served sautéed in garlic butter sauce as an appetizer.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6ccbfa68f5448ee7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The simplest way to cook chicken Balti: amazing recipes</span></p></a><p class=align-left>They taste like chicken because of their mild flavour, with a texture similar to chicken wings. Although frog legs are common in French cuisine, they are also consumed in many parts of the <a href=#>world</a>, including China, Thailand, the Caribbean, Vietnam, and Indonesia.</p><h3>3. Head cheese</h3><p class=align-left>If you have never seen this type of food, you might think it's some variety of fancy cheese. However, the food has nothing to do with cheese but rather a pig's head. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Head cheese</a> is a cold-cut terrine or meat jelly made with flesh from the head of a calf or pig.</p><p class=align-left>It is often eaten cold, at room temperature, or in a sandwich. This type of food is unique for its various textures ranging from crunchy ears to savoury gelatin and creamy pig fat.</p><h3>4. Morcilla blood sausage</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8ba098775f9da3ad.jpg><p class=align-left>Morcilla <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">blood sausage</a> is one of the grossest European foods and one of the world's strangest and most exotic foods. This dish is commonly found in Spain. The dish consists of cooked pork blood mixed with rice and onions and looks like a normal sausage, but it is dark in colour. The texture of the blood sausage is soft, almost creamy.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cf67985ce95de099.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best restaurants in Karen: Give your taste buds a treat</span></p></a><h3>5.

OKroshka</h3><p class=align-left>This is a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cold soup</a> of Russian origin.

Kvass is a fermented low-alcoholic beverage made from rye bread.</p><p class=align-left>It is always served cold and considered the best way to fight the summer heat. Some people associate this food with traditional Russian salads, where every ingredient is chopped into small, almost equal pieces.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fe335a94026cc9b5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Different types of beans (with pictures)</span></p></a><h3>7.
