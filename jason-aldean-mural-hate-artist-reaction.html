Many onlookers compared the rendition of the country star to a Beavis and Butt-Head-esque character, and the singer himself — while he stressed that he appreciated the gesture — relayed his dad's reaction that the artist had "did you dirty."</p><p>"I'm just curious — I don't want to offend the artist because I do appreciate the gesture — but like, gosh, man," Aldean <a href=#>added</a>.</p><p>Now, the artist behind the mural is speaking out, and as it turns out, she's not offended at all. Macon local Shemika Bussey spoke to <a href=#>KHOU 11</a> about the mural and response to it, saying that she's not phased one bit.</p><p>"I love the hate. I was laughing when he said his dad said I did him dirty," she <a href=#>explains</a>.</p><p>Bussey painted the mural a year ago, after her friends asked her to add Aldean's likeness to the side of a Dollar General, underneath a sign that says "Macon's Greatest." The wall also features a painting of singer Otis Redding.</p><p>"I did it in the rain — in two hours because of the rain — and I stood on top of my truck and I did it," Bussey recounts. "And I put my heart into it and I felt so proud when it was done. Nobody could take that away from me."</p><p>That pride in her work hasn't changed, despite anybody's negative comments about the finished product. "I saw was people have an opinion — everybody has a right to their opinion and I'm like, 'That's life,' and in life, people love us or hate us," she says.</p><p>Besides, there's no such thing as bad press, and Bussey's profile has certainly risen due to the buzz surrounding her controversial Jason Aldean mural. According to KHOU 11, she's planning to do a meet-and-greet at the city's South Plaza, off Pio Nono Avenue, on Saturday (Aug. 6). She will have prints of the mural available for sale.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Top 50 Jason Aldean Songs: His Greatest Hits + Best Deep Cuts</h2>The best <a href=#>Jason Aldean</a> songs are spread out among his 11 studio albums.
