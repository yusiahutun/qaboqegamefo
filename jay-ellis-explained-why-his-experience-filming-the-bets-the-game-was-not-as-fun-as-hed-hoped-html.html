Ellis’s introduction only added to more changes fans weren’t comfortable with – <a href=#>as well as his castmates.&nbsp;</a></p><h2><strong>Jay Ellis on ‘The Game’</strong></h2><p id=par-3_49><a href=#>The announcement that Ellis was joining The Game </a>was made in June 2012. He joined as a full-time recurring character in season 6 after the series had been on BET for two seasons as Bryce “Blue” Westbrook, a newly drafted running back to the fictional San Diego Sabers team.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p>Source: YouTube</figure><p id=par-4_54>As a rookie, Blue has trouble fitting in with his team, mainly due to him being drafted as a replacement to the team’s lead. He’s often put through various initiation tests. He enlists the help of his new girlfriend, Keira (Lauren London), who is a former child star struggling to transition into mature roles.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p>Source: YouTube</figure><p id=par-5_46>Together, they try and navigate their new lives both personally and professionally, which often leads to disaster as their worlds overlap in non-productive ways. Their relationship is on-and-off throughout the series, causing tension between Blue and his teammates after he discovers that Keira kisses the quarterback.</p><p id=par-6_33>Blue eventually rises as the star of the team, helping to lead the team to a championship. Ellis was on the show for four full seasons before the show ended in season 9.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_20>Prior to The Game, Ellis worked as a print model and had small roles in Hart of Dixie and NCIS.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Jay Ellis says the cast and viewers of ‘The Game’ was not very welcoming in the beginning</strong></h2><p id=par-8_39>Though The Game turned out to be Ellis’s breakout role, he revealed in his <a href=#>new interview with Essence Magazine</a> that he was not necessarily welcomed with open arms. For starters, not all viewers were not receptive to his character.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p>Source: YouTube</figure><p id=par-9_63>“I remember people laughing at Keira. They did not want to see Blue and Keira at all. They were like, ‘Where is Derwin and Melanie?’,” he said – explaining that the shows lead characters, Pooch Hall and Tia Mowry-Hardrict left the series and Ellis and London were their replacements. “I was like, Oh, my God, this is the worst decision I ever made.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-5 readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/aNx8URB9Ck/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p>Source: Instagram</figure><p id=par-10_21>Adding more stress, Ellis explained that the cast already had established close relationships and he found it hard to fit in.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_65>“I started that show on episode 100. That cast…had already had time to bond, time to fall out, and time to re-bond again,” he said. “So I was the new kid on the block. I was like, ‘Hey, I want to be friends with y’all. You guys want to rehearse? You guys want to throw lines? What y’all want to do?’ They were like ‘no.’”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-6><p></p>Source: YouTube</figure><p id=par-12_37>Despite the hardships, Ellis says he is grateful for The Game but never truly felt comfortable. “I always felt I was a guest in their house. With Insecure, we built that house together. Issa was the architect.”</p><p id=par-13_38>Ellis has been a recurring cast member on Insecure since its inception. This season, he not only continues as a star on the show but also transitioned into the director’s chair, directing episode seven on location in Mexico.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS3osWMnqOloaNisrm8y5qgp52UYsSpxYyhoKxlla29pr7InqWcnV2btq25yKeeZqyYmnqjsdOsZK2glWK0ornEZq6aq12jvLV5wKxkn62eYq60eceem2agn6WypXrHraSlZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
