A child care center in Moline is working to close the gap for parents who need help beyond the usual day shift.
More parents work longer hours, have second jobs or cover odd shifts so they can be home with the for remote learning.
That created a need for daycare with more hours.
The Heritage Academy and Learning Center opened for the first time Monday."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

So the people who work 1-7 or 2-10 this will definitely help them out.”</p><p>With parents working, and dealing with remote learning, the center offers that relief as well.</p><p>“We have an all day pre-school program, also an evening pre-school program. So I think that will help out,” says Amato.</p><p>For single mothers like Juliana Lyon, places like The Heritage Academy are lifesavers. Although they are not common.</p><p>“It’s hard finding child care after hours and on Saturdays. I love that there is a center now that’s opened on Saturdays, So that I’m able to pick up more hours,” says Lyons.</p><p>Parent Sue Holland was working as a real estate agent, but ultimately ended up switching jobs due to a lack of child care after hours.</p><p>“If I ever wanted to return back to real estate. I definitely think I could, because of the extended hours now,” says Holland.</p><p>The Heritage Academy & Learning Center is open Monday-Friday 4:30am- 10:30p.m.</p><p>The center is also open on Saturdays.</p><p>The location is 3812 27th Street in Moline.</p><p>For more information about enrollment contact the center at (309) 269-5688.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaJuopqRixLC%2Bymarq5mUnsGqu82ao2agn6q%2FtHnMqKOippVisaLFwpqpnmWdmrK1v4ynnJ6co2K8p3mRp5tmq5ies7V51qippJ2iqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
