The couple was photographed together partying at Compound Night Club, according to the club’s Instagram account. The adorable couple then took a vacation. Masika, a model, and businesswoman were seen on a boat feeding her man Jamar before sharing a kiss in a video shared on October 8, 2020.</p><p>Jamar, according to Masika, pursued her for over a decade. She did, after all, have a habit of “curving” him. Jamar deserves credit for never giving up. Jamar and Masika are set to marry on December 27, 2020, according to reports. Masika announced their engagement on Twitter after writing “God is so good” with a ring emoji at the end of the tweet.</p><p>The reality star was then photographed cuddling with her fiance Jamar on her Instagram account. Jamar also informed his fans of his engagement in a now-deleted post. “Because she thought it was a game, I married her,” he wrote.</p><p>On his Instagram story, the CEO of J and R Transports also posted a short video of a post-celebration party in which Kalysha was opening a champagne bottle.</p><p>The new couple was showered with congratulations from their fans and well-wishers. “I love that she kept the relationship on the low,” one Twitter user said. Congratulations to her,” says one fan of her writing, while another says, “Everyone deserves love.” Congratulations.”</p><p>As heartwarming as the comments were, suggestions that the model stop criticizing Fetty Wap, the father of her 4-year-old daughter Khari Barbie Maxwell, were unavoidable.</p><p>Masika and Jamar’s engagement lasted only a month. The reality star claimed on her Instagram story that her ex-fiance abused her behind closed doors. She admitted to discovering Pandora’s box of discoveries that caused her to question everything about Jamar. Masika also accused him of attempting to extort her. Finally, she requested that everyone respect her privacy.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Taylor Kitsch Doesn&#39;t Have Time To Date Or Wed"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1086081,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"12":0,"15":"Arial","18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/taylor-kitsch-doesnt-have-time-to-date-or-wed/"}{"1":57}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Taylor Kitsch Doesn’t Have Time To Date Or Wed</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>entrepreneur</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Oloye Alabi</a></h3>Oloye Alabi estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
