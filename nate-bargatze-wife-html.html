He was born on 25 March 1979 in <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Old Hickory</a>, Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.&nbsp;to Italian descent <a href=# rel=follow>father Stephen, a magician and motivational speaker who previously worked as a clown</a>,&nbsp;and mother Carole Bargatze.&nbsp;</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>What is Nate Bargatze's Net Worth?</h2><p>Bargatze's estimated net worth is $5 million dollar.&nbsp;Bargatze also runs a podcast caleed The Nateland Podcast, which he has been featured on his Youtube.</p><p>Bargatze had two stand-up albums, Yelled at by a Clown and Full Time Magic, and high-profile touring experiences before his half-hour special released on Netflix in 2017 as part of its comedy streaming project The&nbsp;Standups. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>While the half-hour special was a relative success, his 2019's released The Tennessee Kid and his 2022's release The Greatest Average American (nominated for 2022's Grammy)&nbsp;stand-up specials completely <a href=# rel="follow noopener">transformed</a> his career, as it brought him closer to a wider audience base that grew every day.&nbsp;</p><p>“The special has changed everything. Netflix is an unbelievable platform for stand-up comics. It just stays up there forever. Every day, you have people discovering you. It’s the best thing that has ever happened to me, except for my family,” Bargatze said of The Tennessee Kid.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2023, his <a href=# rel="follow noopener">The Be Funny tour</a> made the<a href=# rel="follow noopener"> venue's attendance record</a> with 19,365 people at the Bridgestone Arena.&nbsp;</p><p>In the distant past, he had several career experiences before pursuing a career in comedy. He did several stints during his college days, including working as a host at the dine-in restaurant Applebee's (where he met his wife).</p><p>Later, he was reading meters in Mt. Juliet when he decided that he would pursue comedy after a friend of his pitched the idea to him. After that, he took improv comedy classes&nbsp;with a friend at The Second City, moving to Chicago in 2002.</p><p>But he realized that his heart was set on standup comedy and switched to its classes from improv. The next two years after that, he performed in open mics before moving to New York in 2004 to make it big, partly inspired by Jerry Seinfeld's Comedian (2002), a re-invention documentary about the famous comedian's return to comedy clubs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The tour will run till December 2023 in diverse places across the United States&nbsp;and the tickets ( price $35 up and below $100) are available on his website <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Natebargatze Live</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKaRqbJursCrnpqsqpp6uLXFnmWhrJ2h</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
