In the first snap, she is seen taking in the sun in a clear, strapless bikini top with a yellow banana print. She smiles and shields her eyes while posing in the see-through piece, which she paired with a silver necklace and a string bracelet.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the next photo, Pink is seen standing in an outdoor shower, next to a tent, completely naked. She lifts up her arms and smiles widely at the cameraman—her husband. For Instagram, she censored the photo with some colorful doodles.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Lake weekends and a new ridiculous bathing suit. If you haven’t showered outdoors while your husband tries to scare you every five minutes you haven’t lived!!!!!! #embarassingmoms #eyerollsfordays #bananaboobies #imfun #readyfortour,” the pop star captioned the post.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Pink has been married to Hart since 2006. The pair share two kids: Willow and Jameson. Their low-key couple’s getaway comes ahead of the singer’s Summer Carnival and Trustfall tours.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Summer Carnival’s North American leg will begin in Toronto on July 24. The 15-city North American Trustfall Tour will kick off October 12 with a show in Sacramento. A date in Sunrise, Florida, has been added since Pink announced the news of her ninth studio album tour in February, following the album drop.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Trustfall includes hits like lead single “Never Gonna Not Dance Again” and the title track, as well as “When I Get There,” a touching ballad Pink dedicated to her late father. It also features collaborations with Chris Stapleton, the Lumineers, and First Aid Kit.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/49ca5303-a74f-4d73-a0f8-6a94e1338358_1714666618.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" title="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Rosa Sanchez is the senior news editor at Harper's Bazaar, working on news as it relates to entertainment, fashion, and culture.
