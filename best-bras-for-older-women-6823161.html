Because of this, she says that “full-coverage bras won’t work well for older women because the top of the bra cup will be hollow due to loss of volume.” She recommends looking for demi-cup or balconette styles for everyday bras because these types of cups do a great job of lifting and shaping breasts with shallow top cups.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Maidenform’s One Fab Fit is the original T-shirt bra, and it’s available in a demi underwire that checks a lot of boxes for older women. Designed with the brand’s SmartZone cup technology, the Everyday Modern Demi flexes to fit your breasts for better shaping and support. Pair that with an attractive price point, it’s a no fuss bra that’s still plenty sexy, and you won’t find yourself pulling and tugging at it throughout the day.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>A - DD<strong> </strong>|<strong> Colors: </strong>17<strong>&nbsp;</strong>|<strong> Materials: </strong>Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-natori-feathers-bra-basics></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Natori Feathers Bra - Basics</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Natori Feathers Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/SYSMVMxdbu0SiLiFtEVBomvaEg8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/natori-feathers-bra-basics-e8529758496f4af19ec8cb94ebb82c45.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Natori</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>It runs a bit small.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For those looking for a lingerie splurge, Tempesta says the Natori Feathers bra is also great for a shallow top cup. It may be a bit pricey, but it's comfortable enough for everyday wear. The Feathers bra features the brand's signature Italian lace trim, a demi contour cup, a deep plunging neckline, and adjustable stretch straps. According to the website, the Feathers bra runs small, so if you're adding this to your shortlist, think about ordering one cup size up for a better fit.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>A - DD<strong>&nbsp;</strong>|<strong> Colors: 9&nbsp;</strong>|<strong> Materials: </strong>Nylon, lycra</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-wireless-simply-perfect-by-warners-womens-underarm-smoothing-seamless-wireless-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Wireless</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Simply Perfect by Warner's Wireless Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Simply Perfect by Warner's Women's Underarm Smoothing Seamless Wireless Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/fEutnqoqXujMLGhFJsJfXHGcbcY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/target-simply-perfect-by-warners-womens-underarm-smoothing-seamless-wireless-bra-95715cdfb9774cc1bea8e9f3d4575dc0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Underwire bras may not be the most comfortable clothing item in the world, and our guess is that women are just ready to ditch the discomfort at a certain age. But while tossing out anything with an underwire is totally applause-worthy, you still need to support the girls. So, to that end, the Simply Perfect bra by Warner's is an excellent wireless option for older women. This bra features easy sizing, so there's no worry about cup sizes and bands, an extra side panel minimizes underarm bulges, and it's comfortable enough for all-day wear. It doesn’t offer any lift, though, so be aware when you purchase.</p><p><strong>Size Range: </strong>S - XXL<strong> </strong>|<strong> Colors: </strong>7<strong> </strong>|<strong> Materials: </strong>Nylon, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-sports-bra-shefit-ultimate-sports-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Sports Bra</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>SheFit Ultimate Sports Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/TzKF55K4fx4xRkoqz0qRQisFU_E=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/shefit-ultimate-sports-bra-a6ab811342374d62bee812f1ae59d090.jpg"> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With wire-free, seamed cups for shaping and two-way stretch fabric that reduces bounce, this highly-rated sports bra by SheFit offers plenty of comfortable support. The crossback straps offer a bit of lift, while the full coverage bra itself will scoop everything in place. You can even remove the cups for a more customized fit. It features a front closure, so it’s also a great choice for those with limited mobility, whether those limitations are from age or an intense game of pickleball.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We find the sizing to be a bit confusing to understand off the bat, though. SheFit uses their own sizing, so we suggest using the handy size chart to make sure your measurements match up perfectly with the size you think will work best. It supports A-L cups, so you’re bound to find a size that fits you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>XS - 6Luxe<strong> </strong>|<strong> Colors: </strong>8<strong> </strong>|<strong> Materials: </strong>Liner: Nylon, spandex; Shell: Polyester; PowerMesh: Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-sagging-wacoal-la-femme-underwire-t-shirt-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Sagging</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Wacoal Underwire T-Shirt Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Wacoal La Femme Underwire T-Shirt Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/HXRUT7BCzGkAV_cH4kDGzlE9OMI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/wacoal-la-femme-underwire-t-shirt-bra-301e55a193a04bcd8f6e1b35018e5d68.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Wacoal</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>Limited color selection.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sagging breasts are par for the course of aging. Whether your breasts are pendulous (a longer drop with more of the weight sitting closer to the nipple) or they have a shallow top and full bottom, a good bra can keep the girls looking high and tight. In either case, full coverage bras or t-shirt bras with contour cups are best.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For shallow top/full bottom breasts, try Wacoal’s La Femme Underwire T-Shirt Bra. The seamless foam cups lift your bust and give you a rounded shape, while the plunging neckline and embroidered frame keep it super sexy. The wire will get underneath the breast and keep it lifted. For more pendulous breasts, try the similar <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Elevated Allure Underwire Bra</a> because it provides just a touch more lift. We only wish these two bras came in more colors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>B- H<strong> </strong>|<strong> Colors: </strong>4<strong> </strong>|<strong> Materials: </strong>Nylon, spandex, polyester</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-plus-size-chantelle-rive-gauche-full-coverage-unlined-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Chantelle Full Coverage Unlined Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Chantelle Rive Gauche Full Coverage Unlined Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7BkadgumnmWDOHAUGIJOCbUFPLI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/chantelle-rive-gauche-full-coverage-unlined-bra-8ec395a83b164670825b5d025aaf0c82.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Norstrom</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Chantelle’s Rive Gauche Full Coverage Unlined Bra is an ultra-light, full-coverage bra with soft stretch that adjusts to your shape. Angled seaming on the cups supports your breasts and provides plenty of lift; plus, it centers the breast tissue (up to an I cup), ultimately creating the look of a longer, thinner waist. If that weren’t enough, the Rive Gauche bra also features a double-lined mesh band that smooths out your back and underarm bulges. Beyond that, the leotard (or U-shaped) back does the heavy-lifting to take the weight off your shoulders — a common complaint for many plus-size women. Some reviewers complain that the straps are a bit too thin. But support doesn’t come from the straps, so that comes down to personal preference.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>D - I<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>7<strong> </strong>|<strong> Materials: </strong>69% Polyamide, 29% Elastane, 2% Polyester</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-strapless-wacoal-red-carpet-strapless-underwire-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Strapless</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Wacoal Red Carpet Strapless Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/6wTcruZ9a8_lvXdCh4Hy94v-Jlg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/wacoal-red-carpet-strapless-87f83ea2b48847e698458ce09cd6d21a.jpg"> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re headed out for the night or enjoying the Summer sun in something strapless, Alice Kim recommends the Wacoal Red Carpet strapless bra. “The Red Carpet strapless has padded support on the center gore and the frame for superior comfort and no digging, the Silicone strip along the inside perimeter, while designed to stay put, it’s not sticky or painful, and the wings have boning on the side seam and back band for added support, so it doesn’t collapse,” says&nbsp;Kim. If that weren’t plenty, the band and sides are designed to minimize any bulging.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the Red Carpet bra is strapless, it’s comfortable enough for everyday use, and should you decide to wear it as such, it comes with straps that convert it to a traditional bra, a halter, crisscross, and one-shoulder styles. Kim also notes that the Red Carpet, strapless, tends to run big, so you could size down by one cup size — we suggest trying it on in store first to figure out the best size for you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We wish that the brand would expand their nude color options to be more inclusive.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>B - I |<strong> Colors: </strong>4 |<strong> Materials: </strong>Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-front-closure-spanx-bra-llelujah-lightly-lined-full-coverage-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Front Closure</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Spanx Bra-llelujah Full Coverage Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Spanx Bra-llelujah!

Enter: front closure bras, like this one from Spanx. This bra is a cinch to put on and take off, no acrobatics or extra stretching required. We’re also impressed by the thought put into the back design of this bra; it’s made completely out of hosiery for a smoothing effect (read: no visible lines through your shirt), and there are even added “support” zones in the back to help prevent boob-induced back pain. Our only complaint is that the shoulder straps aren’t adjustable (although the “Smart Stretch” fabric claims to be self-adjusting); double-check your measurements and the size guide before order.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range</strong>: A - DD | <strong>Colors</strong>: 6 | <strong>Materials</strong>: Nylon, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-large-chests-knix-wingwoman-contour-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Large Chests</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Knix WingWoman Contour Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1500 data-sizes=750px alt="Knix WingWoman Contour Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/fbKYgJh6NUYOrdiWJT3YqwWCqwU=/fit-in/1500x1500/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/wingwoman-contour-bra-3734baef44894cc59764c654f7409282.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Knix</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: This wireless bra doesn’t skimp on support.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love</strong>: The sizing guide is confusing for first-time buyers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You may think that “large chest” and “wireless bra” can’t co-exist, especially when your goal is to find a bra that lifts, separates, and supports. We’re thrilled to say the Knix WingWoman Contour Bra is one of the best bras for older women who have ample assets. It truly is the best of everything: low-cut but full-coverage, wireless but supportive, and comfortable yet modling. In particular, we loved that there was plenty of side coverage (no spilling over the cups), and the lined, molded cups guarded us from any nipple protrusion. The final effect looked elegant, smooth, and shapely. A word to the wise: Knix has a unique sizing system that can confuse new shoppers.

Of course, you can rock your asymmetrical look au natural, but if you’re self-conscious about it, the Third Love 24/7 Classic Uplift Plunge Bra offers an innovative solution. The removable pads (almost like what you’d find in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sports bra</a>) help you adjust your cleavage until you’ve got your desired look. Third Love is also known for their half-sizes, giving you even more assistance in finding the perfect fit. Heads up, though: The cup lining is pretty thin, so a few things might poke through, if you follow.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> AA - H <strong>| Colors:</strong> 13<strong> | Materials: </strong>Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Cup Size</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Caitlyn Parish, co-founder and CDO of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Cicinia</a> says, “The first thing to consider when picking a new bra for an older woman is their size. She may have been wearing a 34C in her youth, but now she’s probably wearing a 32DD or 32E. A good rule of thumb is that you should never buy a smaller size than your current measurements. While this may make you appear more youthful, it also puts you at risk of suffering from poor posture and back pain when wearing the smaller size.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Underband</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Tempesta also suggests keeping an eye on the band of the bra. “If it’s riding up in the back, or you can pull it out away from your back more than three inches, the bra is likely too big,” she says. “Another sign of a band that’s too big is that you consistently hook it on the tightest hook. A band that’s too small is obvious to most wearers because it is on the loosest hook and uncomfortably snug.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Elastics get stretchier with age. To improve longevity, Tempesta advises hooking the band on the loosest setting when you fit the bra. If you start on the loosest setting, you can move on to the middle hooks and eventually to the tightest setting as the bra ages.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Shoulder Straps</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Tempesta, one of the most overlooked areas in bra fitting is a shoulder slope and shoulder width evaluation. She says, “If you have narrow and/or sloping shoulders, you should opt for racerback or X back styles because straight straps will likely fall off your shoulders.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">She goes on to say, “Your straps shouldn’t be adjusted the same on both sides.

However, if you want bras with more intricate detailing like lace, then the percentage of nylon may be higher.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Does my breast size change as I get older?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Your breasts change throughout your lifetime. Where they ultimately end up as you age is anyone’s guess. It’s not uncommon for women to find that the bra size they wore in their 30s doesn’t work for them in their 50s and 60s. Common factors that affect your breast size and shape are pregnancy, breastfeeding, pre-menopause, and menopause.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What size should I buy if my breasts are different sizes now?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Jenette Goldstein, founder and CEO of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Jenette Bras</a>, says, “Everybody’s [breasts are different sizes], but if the difference is significant, that does present a challenge.
