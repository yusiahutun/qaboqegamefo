What Causes a Smart Switch to Disconnect?  Smart switches are among the best products to increase your home's IQ, but they depend on a wireless internet connection to function correctly."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

When this connection is interrupted, the switch can stop responding to voice or app commands. You may also notice the LED on the switch turns red or blinks.</p><p>To get the switch working properly, you'll first need to troubleshoot and identify the cause of the disconnection. Fortunately, the disconnect only occurs for one of a handful of reasons.</p><h3 id=upgraded-internet-equipment>Upgraded Internet Equipment</h3><p>Oftentimes, a smart switch will stop working due to incompatible Wi-Fi. Many newer routers use a 5GHz signal by default, which means some older 2.4GHz switches will not connect after a router upgrade.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In this case, you either have to switch off 5GHz or replace older 2.4GHz switches. In the same vein, if you’ve moved your router, the switch might now be out of range. Consider moving your router to a more central location, allowing it to service all of your smart devices. If you have a large home, <a href=#>consider using multiple routers</a> to avoid lapses in coverage.</p><h3 id=power-outages>Power Outages</h3><p>If your switch stops functioning after a recent storm or other power outage, this is probably the cause. Not only can power outages affect smart home components, but power surges can also damage your router. When this happens, you’ll have to fix the router before you can reset your smart light switch.</p><h3 id=internet-outages>Internet Outages</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Aqara-Light-Switch-Blue.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is another common reason for smart switches to become temperamental. When you discover your light switch is offline, you should check to ensure your internet connection is still working. While this seems like common sense, you’d be surprised how many times a spotty internet connection is responsible for a switch that refuses to work.</p><h3 id=wireless-password-changes>Wireless Password Changes</h3><p>If you’ve changed your router password recently, then you’ll need to update your switch’s Wi-Fi credentials to reconnect it to your home network.</p><p>Resetting old passwords is an essential part of having a secure network, but Wi-Fi password changes can wreak havoc on smart home products. Before you change your Wi-Fi password, consider the number of devices you’ll have to reconnect when you make the change.</p><h3 id=internal-equipment-malfunction>Internal Equipment Malfunction</h3><p>If you’ve purchased inexpensive light switches from some discount retailers, the switches may have malfunctioned internally. Occasionally, the low prices on these units reflect sub-par manufacturing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When planning on upgrading your home with smart lighting, it’s always better to purchase products from a trusted manufacturer with a comprehensive warranty—especially when dealing with electrical products that attach to your home’s wiring. Smart Life and Kasa are two leading manufacturers of smart home products, including smart light switches that are highly rated for their ease of installation, compatibility with Alexa and Google Assistant, and app control. As with any smart home product purchase, we recommend reading consumer reviews before pulling the trigger on a smart light switch.</p><h3 id=recent-firmware-updates>Recent Firmware Updates</h3><p>Sometimes, updating the firmware on a smart switch will cause the unit to lose access to your Wi-Fi network. When this happens, a quick reset should get the switch working again. The steps to reset smart switches vary by manufacturer, but they typically involve holding down a button until it changes color. A quick Google search will get you there: "how to reset smart light switch" followed by the name of your manufacturer (e.g., Kasa, Smart Life, Eaton).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=do-i-have-to-replace-the-switch>Do I Have to Replace the Switch?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Aqara-Switch-Red-Disconnected-.jpg><p>In most cases, you will not have to replace a malfunctioning smart switch. However, if your switch shows visible damage, such as burn marks, or you smell burning plastic near the unit, you likely need to replace your light switch. You should also always replace a switch that trips electrical breakers.</p><p>If any of these signs are present, consult an electrician immediately, as you may have problems with the wiring in your home. If you're not seeing any signs of damage, you can usually get by with a simple smart switch reset to reconnect your device.</p><h2 id=how-to-reconnect-your-smart-light-switch>How to Reconnect Your Smart Light Switch</h2><p>Reconnecting a smart switch usually consists of three steps:</p><li>Put your smart switch into discovery mode.</li><li>Connect your mobile device to the smart switch.</li><li>Connect your smart switch to your wireless internet via the mobile device.</li><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In some cases, resetting a Wi-Fi switch can result in the loss of automations. Before you begin the reset procedure, make sure to record these to re-establisher after the reset.</p><p>For this guide, we’ve also included reset procedures for some of the most common smart switches. While this list isn’t comprehensive, your switch may have a similar reset procedure. For full details, you should always consult the documentation that came with your model.</p><p>In this example, we’re using a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Kasa Smart switch by TP-Link</a>. To put this switch into discovery mode, you’ll need to turn the switch on and then hold the button until the LED starts flashing.</p><p>For other switches, such as the Lutron Caseta, rapidly tap the on button three times. On the third tap, hold the button until the dimmer lights begin to cycle. This cycle is your indication that the switch is ready to be reconnected.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Green-Double-Gang-Kasa-Switch.jpg><p>For Insignia switches, hold the reset button. After 10 seconds, the switch should click. Continue to hold the reset button for another five seconds, and you should hear a second click. The second click activates discovery mode. Once you hear it, you can release the button.</p><p>If you have a Belkin Wemo switch, first press the button for one second and release. Then press and hold the button for five seconds. After five seconds, release the button. Your Wemo switch should blink orange rapidly, indicating it is now ready to reconnect.</p><p>Finally, Feit smart switches take a little more work to reset. First, you’ll need to remove the wall plate. Once you remove the plate, you’ll find an air gap slider inside. Pull out the air gap slider, then hold the button on the switch for 20 seconds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Note:</strong> Removing the wall plate for your smart switch exposes your home’s high-voltage wiring. Touching live wires can result in serious injury. If you are uncomfortable around live wiring, please consult a certified electrician before attempting to reset your switch.</p><p>Some manufacturers also allow you to reset your smart switch from an app without pressing any physical buttons. Consult your switch’s documentation to find out if this is possible with your specific model.</p><h2 id=use-the-app-to-reconnect-to-wi-fi>Use the App to Reconnect to Wi-Fi</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kasa-Smart-Add-Device.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kasa-Smart-Add-Switch.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kasa-Smart-Is-Switch-Installed.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kasa-Smart-Is-Switch-Blinking.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kasa-Smart-Connect-Smart-Switch-to-wireless.jpg> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>After the switch is in discovery mode, open the companion app on your mobile device. Using the app will allow you to select your model and start the pairing process.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The app should ask to connect to your Wi-Fi. Enter your credentials, and the switch should reconnect. After this process is complete, test the switch by cycling it on and off a few times.</p><h2 id=enjoy-your-reconnected-smart-switch>Enjoy Your Reconnected Smart Switch</h2><p>When working correctly, smart light switches offer convenience and voice control of your home’s lighting.
