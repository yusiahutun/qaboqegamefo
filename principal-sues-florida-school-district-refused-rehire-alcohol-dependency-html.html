Dr. Mary Williams is seeking damages of $30,000, claiming the Seminole County school board discriminated against her 'based on a handicap or disability,' the lawsuit obtained by Daily Mail shows.
Williams, who held the top job at Hagerty High School, was named Seminole's principal of the year in 2018, according to the Orlando Sentinel."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Each category has various symptoms and can cause harmful side effects.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>If left untreated, any type of alcohol abuse can spiral out of control.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Individuals struggling with alcoholism often feel as though they cannot function normally without alcohol.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This can lead to a wide range of issues and impact professional goals, personal matters, relationships and overall health.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Sometimes the warning signs of alcohol abuse are very noticeable. Other times, they can take longer to surface.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When alcohol addiction is discovered in its early stages, the chance for a successful recovery increases significantly.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Common signs of alcoholism include:</span></p><ul class=mol-bullets-with-font><li>Being unable to control alcohol consumption</li><li>Craving alcohol when you’re not drinking</li><li>Putting alcohol above personal responsibilities</li><li>Feeling the need to keep drinking more</li><li>Spending a substantial amount of money on alcohol</li><li>Behaving differently after drinking</li></ul><p class=mol-para-with-font>Short-term effects of alcohol abuse can be just as dangerous as long-term effects.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>For instance, drinking can impact your reaction time, causing you to have slow reflexes and coordination.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>That’s why drinking and driving is extremely dangerous. Getting behind the wheel of a car can alter your perception of speed and distance, putting yourself and others at risk.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Several short-term effects of alcohol abuse may produce:</span></p><ul class=mol-bullets-with-font><li>Slow reaction time</li><li>Poor reflexes</li><li>Reduce brain activity</li><li>Lowered inhibitions</li><li>Blurry vision</li><li>Difficulty breathing</li><li>Restlessness</li></ul><p class=mol-para-with-font>Additionally, consuming too much alcohol can affect your long-term health. Some side effects may lay dormant for years before they surface.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Because of this, professional medical care is required for proper diagnosis and treatment.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Long-term health conditions caused by alcohol:</span></p><ul class=mol-bullets-with-font><li>Brain defects&nbsp;</li><li>Liver disease</li><li>Diabetes complications</li><li>Heart problems</li><li>Increased risk of cancer</li><li>Vision damage</li><li>Bone loss&nbsp;</li></ul><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Treatment for Alcoholism&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>There are different forms of treatment available based on frequency and severity of alcohol abuse.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Recovering from alcohol addiction is a process that continues long after rehab.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It takes commitment to practice and apply the techniques you learn in rehab, counseling, support groups and other types of therapy.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Although every individual will have their own recovery plan that’s tailored to their specific needs, treatment generally follows a structure.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Alcohol treatment is broken into three sections, consisting of:</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Detoxification</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The first stage in alcohol addiction recovery is detoxification. This phase should be completed with the help of medical professionals due to the potential for serious, uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms. Many times, individuals are given a medication to help alleviate the painful side effects of a withdrawal.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Rehabilitation</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>There are two types of rehabilitation that help treat alcoholism: inpatient rehab and outpatient rehab. Inpatient rehabs are intensive treatment programs that require you to check into a facility for a certain period of time, usually 30, 60 or 90 days. Outpatient rehab allows individuals to participate in a recovery program while continuing with their daily life. Talk with your doctor about treatment options to determine which form of recovery will best fit your needs.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Maintenance</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The recovery process doesn’t end with the completion of rehab. Long-term sobriety requires ongoing therapy and may entail support groups, counseling and other recovery resources. These will make sure you maintain sobriety and continue on a happy, healthy path for months and years to come.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Source: <a style=font-weight:700 rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Alcohol Rehab Guide</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWKGcn%2BXbm1uZ4Cntq%2BvyKmYpWWjqrK0eaWlpquhlJZ6tK%2FHqKalZZSewLW%2ByJyrZqqVm8K0scNmqZ6gmaeybq3LnKahp5xisaa8xKebnqaTrnupwMyl</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
