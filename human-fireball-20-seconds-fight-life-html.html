Spencer Beach, 49, was turned into a human fireball when a blaze erupted on a house he was working on in Edmonton, Kentucky in the U.S. 
The dad was laying down flooring when flames ripped through the home setting him on fire for 20 agonising seconds and leaving 90 per cent of his body covered in third and fourth degree burns."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It saves both time and money, but it comes with one fault - it is explosive.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Had his employer required its workers to remove the flooring the proper, longer way, Spencer's tragic incident could have been prevented. But Spencer still partially blames himself, and insists he won't be ignoring alarm bells again.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He said: 'I had a feeling removing flooring with that chemical wasn't right, but I failed to listen to my gut feeling. By not listening to myself and doing nothing to control that hazard my gut was warning about, I effectively did nothing to control the risk.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-italic">MailOnline have contacted Spencer's representative for further comments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In April 2013, a <a style=font-weight:700 class=class href=#>builder in China</a><a style=font-weight:700 class=class href=#>&nbsp;survived an horrific accident which saw a foot long metal bar impaled</a> in his head.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Jin Hongping was working in the city of Linxia in northwest China's Ganua province, when the 40 cm bar dropped from a height and went through his skull.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2Bc4OUamxycV%2Bdwq6tzWadoqqVl66tuIxrZ2arlZi8r7DSZp2in5ipeq21xZ5loaydoQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
