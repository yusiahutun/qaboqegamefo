No, that would be weird.

At the least, it would have been extraordinary in complexity, one of those recipes that imagine you’d like to tether yourself to the freezer for an afternoon in the name of a stunning striated popsicle, frozen in segregated layers (but that, sadly, disappear in the exact same amount of time as the frozen juice varieties do). You wouldn’t guess that it might be a popsicle with but five ingredients, one that is no more complicated than a pinch of salt and another that comes straight from a can.</p><p><a title="you can use regular limes, too" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm3.staticflickr.com/2827/9591709881_6b77a14a82_z.jpg alt="you can use regular limes, too" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><a title="so much lime juice" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7335/9594506022_8958e16bd9_z.jpg alt="so much lime juice" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>But when we tried one, I swear, the world stopped for a second. The lime was so bracingly tart, the sweetened condensed milk was so rich with concentrated creaminess, the exterior crunch of ground cookies so brilliant that we had to sit down for a minute and consider the nirvana it all. <a href=#>Tina Fey</a> once said that she believes that all anyone really wants in this life is to <a href=#>sit in peace</a> and eat a sandwich, but I think it’s just because she hasn’t had one of these yet.</p><p><a title="key lime pie popsicles" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm6.staticflickr.com/5477/9594507096_3c28dbb557_z.jpg alt="key lime pie popsicles" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Before this, I hadn’t considered that popsicles were just a format, a shape you could mold your favorite desserts into, rendering them more portable and perfect for sticky hot summer days.

However, the name “lime pie” just doesn’t evoke what I wanted it to, which was the sheer lime-and-cream deliciousness the pie is known for. These popsicles, despite the sweetness from the condensed milk, are surprisingly tart. The preschooler wanted no part in them, which just meant that there were more for us, nyah-nyah.</p><p>No popsicle molds? You could any kind of tiny cup to mold them instead, but my favorite is a champagne flute for shape; you could even use those disposable plastic ones. When the mixture is halfway frozen, insert a popsicle stick and now no retro popsicle mold needs to come between you and Popsicle Week.</p><p>Makes 10 1/3-cup or 3-ounce popsicles</p><p>Approximately 4 large regular limes or 6 to 7 <i>several</i> key limes<br>1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk<br>1 cup half-and-half (or, 1/2 cup heavy cream + 1/2 cup milk)<br>Pinch of salt<br>3 cups coarsely crushed graham crackers or Maria cookies</p><p>Zest however many of the limes needed until you have 2 teaspoons total in the bottom of a medium bowl. Juice limes until you have 3/4 cup fresh lime juice. Add juice, condensed milk, half-and-half and salt to zest and whisk together until thoroughly combined. Pour into popsicle molds. Freeze for about 5 hours, or until completely frozen.</p><p>Dip in lukewarm water for 10 seconds to unmold each popsicle and press each side into crushed cookie crumbs, coating completely.</p><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-10650 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-10650 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
