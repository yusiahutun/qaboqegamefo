Michael previously shared his thoughts on the stage adaptation, calling the production “pretty good quality.”</span></p><p><span>“I was really taken [by the fact] that they’re not trying to do us. They’re trying to do a new thing,” he added. “It’s an independent piece based on the same set of ideas and characters.”</span></p><p><span>Michael’s appearance at the gala came just months after he candidly shared an update on his battle with Parkinson’s disease.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“It sucks, having Parkinson’s … It’s getting tougher, it’s getting harder, every day you suffer but that’s the way it is,” he said during an April TV appearance.</span></p><p><span>He also revealed all of the health ailments he has suffered over the years in addition to fighting Parkinson’s, including undergoing spinal surgery and breaking bones in his face, arms, elbow and hand.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“All these subtle ways that get you, you don’t die from Parkinson’s, you die with Parkinson’s,” Michael said. “I’m not going to be 80. I won’t be 80.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46moJygkZq5braMn6axZaKawq%2B1056qZq%2BZqbVursCcomasn2LBqbGMn6ytraKaeqS70q2Yq6tf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
