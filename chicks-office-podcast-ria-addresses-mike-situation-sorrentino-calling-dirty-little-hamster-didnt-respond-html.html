He replied to his tweet with another reading: “Go do another&nbsp;@JerseyShore special collect your money and respectfully shut your mouth.” He’s referring to the&nbsp;<a href=#>Jerztory: How Jersey Shore Changed TV</a>&nbsp;special that aired in September 2022 and featured Ria and her&nbsp;Chicks in the Office&nbsp;co-star Francesca “Fran” Mariano.&nbsp;The two provided commentary and celebrated the 10+ years of success Jersey Shore has experienced.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-3_54>Mike’s reply tweet included the iconic GIF of him from&nbsp;Jersey Shore&nbsp;Season 2 when he called Angelina Pivarnick a “dirty little hamster.” Ria didn’t reply or react to the tweet, leaving many fans confused about Mike’s comments in the first place.

I’m OK because I have said many, many, many times how much I love them and how much I love the original&nbsp;Jersey Shore.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_52>According to the Barstool celebrity, the <a href=#>cast of&nbsp;Jersey Shore</a>&nbsp;saw a clip of her explaining “an MTV problem, not a&nbsp;Jersey Shore&nbsp;problem.” She added: “MTV just needs to … what happened when they created all these different shows. We want more of that. I also said if I was them, I’d keep getting paid.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_29>Mike wasn’t happy with the comments Ria made presumably about wanting the original series back instead of&nbsp;Jersey Shore: Family Vacation. Apparently neither was the rest of the cast.</p><p id=par-7_19>“Actually, none of them were happy with me,” Ria added. “I got dirty little hamstered, and I didn’t respond.”</p><h2 id=h-why-ria-didn-t-respond-to-mike-the-situation-s-tweet>Why Ria didn’t respond to Mike ‘The Situation’s tweet&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-8_54>As for why Ria didn’t address the tweet until three days later, she said: “I figured, ‘What’s the use of going back and forth with these people?’ I’m not taking it back.
