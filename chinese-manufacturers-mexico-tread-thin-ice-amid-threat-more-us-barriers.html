The other one is like, when companies come set up as a Mexican manufacturing facility here, hiring Mexican employees and complying with the rule of origin, they can definitely supply to the US market free of taxes,” said Emmanuel Loo, undersecretary of investment of the Ministry of Economy in Nuevo Leon, where Monterrey is the capital.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Under the USMCA, which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) in 2020, as long as 75 per cent of auto content – including key parts – are made in North America, the products can qualify for rule of origin to export to the US.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2024/03/28/CLEAN-THUMB.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since the fourth quarter of 2021, 30 per cent of all foreign companies investing in Nuevo Leon have been from China, compared to 55 per cent from the US during the same period, Loo said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We didn’t used to have that many Chinese companies. We once had a lot of Koreans, Japanese and Europeans. Now China has become the strong No 2 investor in Monterrey,” Loo said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In value terms, Chinese investment in the state is still in its infancy, as small suppliers rather than big international brands constituted the majority.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to official statistics, in the first three quarters of 2023, the top sources of foreign direct investment in Nuevo Leon were Argentina at US$1.39 billion, the Netherlands at US$557 million and the US at US$401 million, while that from China was only US$34.8 million.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">US-Mexico-Canada trade deal signed after political breakthrough</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the number may be underestimated. Some Chinese companies have used their overseas subsidiary to invest in Mexico to avoid being labelled as “Chinese investment” in the official record, according to factory managers and experts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Therefore, from 2018 to 2023, in Mexico the actual figure for Chinese foreign direct investment – which traces the original source of transactions back to the country – should be about US$10 billion, compared with the US$2.3 billion total from Mexico’s Secretariat of Economy, according to Enrique Dussel-Peters, a professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Nuevo Leon, there have been some Chinese companies coming and setting up facilities without notifying the local government, Loo said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“For some of them, we only found out when, for example, the labour secretary went there for inspections,” Loo added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Beyond these precautions, many Chinese factory managers said they believe that strict compliance with the USMCA will eventually save them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/05/0b498a36-3e74-422f-ad57-a2a6b5077048_c6931432.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“From the business perspective, we cannot be just scared away. The Chinese can always find a way out,” said Chen Yi, an administration director at Hengli Mexico.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Originally from Jiangsu province, Hengli is a hydraulic component supplier to engine equipment manufacturers like Caterpillar, and its plant in Monterrey is expected to begin operations this year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As long as we comply with all the requirements under the USMCA and obtain the rule of origin certificate, and be ready for inspections and review at all times,” Chen said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Jorge Guajardo, former Mexican ambassador to China and currently a partner at Dentons Global Advisors, said the US could easily use non-tariff barriers to make it harder for Chinese-funded companies to prove they meet the rule of origin.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During USMCA negotiations, the US added a chapter in which US labour groups can request inspections at foreign plants in Mexico when labour rights violations are suspected.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">As Chinese firms launch Mexican operations, managers learn cultural lessons</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“So far, it has been used more as harassment than an actual implementation. And my guess is they are going to start targeting Chinese-owned companies in Mexico,” Guajardo said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This echoes the experience of a Chinese factory manager in Monterrey, whose company’s products are undergoing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation by the US.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If the United States really wants to target a certain company, the USMCA would not be able to protect you at all,” the manager said on condition of anonymity.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In December, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen visited Mexico to strengthen cooperation on security and financial issues, with the two sides agreeing to establish a mechanism to monitor and screen foreign investments in the country.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/07/10/clean-thumb.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">03:44</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Yellen hails ‘step forward’ in US-China ties despite national security concerns</p><p>Yellen hails ‘step forward’ in US-China ties despite national security concerns</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But some Mexican officials and trade experts say no one in the country knows how to implement such an investment screening.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kenneth Smith-Ramos, a partner at Mexican international consulting firm Agon and the country’s former chief negotiator for USMCA, said the Mexican government would balk at a practice that it would see as discriminating against foreign firms.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There is an open investment environment [in Mexico],” Smith-Ramos said in March, adding that excluding Chinese participation under USMCA is hard to implement or justify based on current international trading rules.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“How do you not get onto a slippery slope where other countries start discriminating against North American products just by virtue of being North American, and by claiming that they can be a danger to national security of other export markets that are important to North America?” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Still, US pressure on the Mexican government can never be overlooked owing to the leverage that Washington has. Around 85 per cent of Mexico’s exports go to the US, and Mexico overtook China last year to become America’s top source of imports.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are just too dependent on America as a partner,” said Victor Gonzalez, a senior adviser for China-Latin America legal affairs at Beijing-based law firm PC Woo & Zhonglun Wende.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For the economic relationship between China and Mexico, it is never truly bilateral but always trilateral, as the US is always in the equation, he added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s just a matter of time that it becomes political and the economic aspect will become secondary,” Gonzalez said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">With ‘made-by-China’ under US pressure, Mexico’s trade probes spark concerns</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nevertheless, the US’s dependence on lower-cost products made in Mexico and the inability of local industry to provide all the necessary elements of the supply chain presented an opportunity for Beijing, said Eduardo Tzili-Apango, professor of China studies at Mexico’s Metropolitan Autonomous University.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He stressed that trade relations between Mexicans and Chinese have always been contentious, as many sectors such as footwear, textiles and toys have suffered from Chinese competition since the country became a member of the World Trade Organization in 2001.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But as Mexico was unable to advance in more technology-intensive sectors, such as electronic components, inevitably it became dependent on the Chinese supply chain.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In order to … export more to the North American market, we have to import more from China,” Tzili-Apango said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/05/741b3067-01b1-45c6-b4fe-8be153f22efe_b6acfad7.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For Simon Zhao, who came to Mexico from China 14 years ago and later founded Solarever, a Mexican solar panel manufacturer now expanding business scope to EV and batteries, industrial inputs from the Chinese supply chain are irreplaceable for his industry.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Of course we need suppliers from China. As a leader in Mexico for the renewable energy sector, if we want to grow better, we need to cooperate internationally, including with China, the US and Europe,” Zhao said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite policy uncertainties, for many Chinese manufacturers that have already set foot in Mexico, there is almost no way back.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We have bought land and built factories. Of course we are worried. But now we can only move forward,” said Eric Liu, general manager at Sunon, an office furniture producer in Mexico.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The company, originally from Zhejiang province, was convinced by its US clients to move to Mexico in 2021, and invested US$70 million in its Monterrey factory that went into operation two years later.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">China’s 17-year run as top source of US imports ends as Mexico rises</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Compared to the automobile sector, the furniture industry involves fewer technical barriers, and thus has attracted little US attention. But higher costs – from labour, logistics and local procurement in order to comply with the rule of origin under the USMCA – have yet to justify the move, Liu said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As of the end of last year, Sunon’s general operation costs in Mexico were 38 per cent higher than in China, compared with the 25 per cent US tariffs imposed on furniture imports directly from China.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If Trump gets elected again and elevates tariffs on Chinese imports, producing in Mexico would make more sense,” Liu said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The former president, however, could be an “even bigger disruptive element” for the economic dynamic between China and Mexico, said Tzili-Apango.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If Trump wins, one of the biggest political pressures on Mexico might be renegotiating USMCA with the condition that we reduce our trade relations with China,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“And that would be very harmful to our economy.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Additional reporting by Igor Patrick</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelnyivtOimqWdX2h%2FdoOYbmxom5ieu6a%2FxGakmqalm66kwNSrnKurXaKyubXCqGStqpWWsW7Ax6KlZqGTmnqiucidZK2gopqutXnMqKmeZaWoeqOt0augnqqj</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
