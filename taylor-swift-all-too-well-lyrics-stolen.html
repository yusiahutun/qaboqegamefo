Just 10 days after releasing 'Red,' Taylor Swift is facing accusations that she stole a line from her new song 'All Too Well' from singer-songwriter Matt Nathanson.
According to ONTD, Nathanson wrote lyrics similar to Swift's in a song called 'I Saw,' which appears on his 2003 album 'Beneath These Fireworks.' As Swift knows now, hell has no fury like a songwriter scorned."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Just 10 days after releasing 'Red,' <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> is <a href=#>facing accusations</a> that she stole a line from her new song 'All Too Well' from singer-songwriter Matt Nathanson.<span id=more-134394></span></p><p>According to <a href=#>ONTD</a>, Nathanson wrote lyrics similar to Swift's in a song called 'I Saw,' which appears on his 2003 album 'Beneath These Fireworks.' As Swift knows now, hell has no fury like a songwriter scorned.</p><p>On her 'Red' album, Swift sings “And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to.” Back in 2003, Nathanson recorded a line close to just that: “And I’ll forget about you long enough to forget why I need to.”</p><p>Nathanson took to his Twitter account to air his grievances last week, accusing her publicly. “She’s definitely a fan… and now she’s a thief" he posted to his account, before changing his mind and deleting the 140-character jab.</p><p>But then he called out the 'Begin Again' hitmaker for a second time when he re-tweeted a post from a fellow songwriter. “It would be awesome if Taylor Swift’s next album contained a song called, ‘Oh, s—. Maybe it’s ME,’” read the tweet.</p><p>Naturally, an arsenal of Swift's fans and Twitter followers came to her rescue, calling Nathanson harsh names and letting him know in no uncertain terms that they think he's a liar.</p><p>"So far, my favorite thing about today is the wave of @taylorswift13 fans calling me a prick on twitter for writing 'I Saw' in 2003," he <a href=#>posted</a> earlier today (Nov. 2).</p><p>It's hard to say what actually went down with the 'All Too Well' vs. 'I Saw' battle -- and truth be told, the line is not so original that it couldn't be created organically twice. Swift credits Liz Rose with co-writing the song with her, but perhaps Nathanson deserves a nod, too. It's hard to deny that those 13 words are almost exactly the same -- honest mistake or not.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmrZmpobyzedKwoJ%2BsXZa5rXnTqKZmr5WhuW642KugnKtdqMGwuMSnZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
