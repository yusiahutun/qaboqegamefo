Or at least, I have been manifesting this trend by incessantly wearing clogs recently. Now, Jennifer Garner has joined in on my obsession and wore a pair, which means this unexpected summer shoe is on its way to the mainstream.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Garner was seen wearing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">a classic pair of No. 6 Old School high-heel clogs</a> while out in Brentwood last week. Even though Garner styled hers with a pair of washed denim jeans — likely <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">by a brand like Paige</a> or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">Joe's Jeans</a>, her favorites — and a ruffled pink top, you can wear clogs with pretty much anything. Since they're not most people's footwear go-to, they feel unexpected and fresh every time you wear them. If you feel like what you're wearing is boring, throw on a clog, and it'll instantly feel more interesting.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like Birkenstocks, clogs are sometimes labeled as "ugly" (I think they're gorgeous). But their appeal lies less in the labels people put on them and more on the fact that they are extremely comfortable. And if they're good enough for Galliano's Dior (there are a vintage <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="clickref=${DOC_ID}&clickref2=${REQUEST_ID}">pair of Galliano Dior clogs on Etsy I wish were my size</a>), they're more than good enough for me.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The best thing about clogs, aside from how comfortable and unexpected they are, is that some versions are also relatively affordable. Target has a pair that doesn't look<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"> that different from Garner's for just $11</a>. Naturally Amazon has some options for as little <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">as $50 from '90s brands like Rocket Dog</a>. And while Birkenstock is known more <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">for its famous Arizona sandal</a>, the brand also makes the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">best-selling Boston clog</a> that is essentially chic <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>enough for one half of the Olsen sisters</a>. In my opinion, Free People also stocks some of the best clogs on the market. I can't stop wearing these <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=6 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">Culver City clogs</a>, recently bought a blue pair by Anna Sui, and currently have my <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=7 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">eye on the under-$100 Alma clog</a> from there.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But as already mentioned, clogs can be luxurious, and Galliano wasn't the last person to think so. Gucci currently makes a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">horsebit clog</a> (naturally) for $1,100. If you need some added height, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">Stella McCartney has a platform pair of slingback clogs</a> complete with a saw-toothed sole. The buzzy brand of the moment, Bottega Veneta, also made a pair of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">$510 slingback clogs</a> made of a biodegradable polymer that comes in pastel pink. But it's the Bottega clog's product description that says it all: "Bottega Veneta proves clogs are cool again." They said it!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Clearly, high-end brands, Jennifer Garner, and I are all in agreement. Which means, in my honest opinion, clogs are the next It shoe to keep your eyes on. They're already on their way to replacing Birkenstocks as the most contentious shoe on the market, so get in on it now before they're everywhere.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shop the Jennifer Garner-approved clog trend below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3yrsc2noJ%2BdomK0or7Nnqlmq6Wiuqa%2BjJyjqJ9dqb%2BmusM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
