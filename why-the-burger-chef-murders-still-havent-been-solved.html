According to Indianapolis Monthly, police were informed of the disappearance of the four Burger Chef employees from their workplace shortly after midnight on November 18, but failed to recognize that the employees' absence might indicate that they were in mortal danger."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Instead, police&nbsp;suspected the youngsters themselves of embezzlement; that they had ditched their jobs, taken off the with money, and gone "joyriding."</p><p dir=ltr>As such, the Burger Chef was allowed to be cleaned and reopened with other staff the next day, ultimately destroying any vital evidence that may have given a clue to the events of November 17. "They didn't process it as a murder; they didn't know it was a murder," detective Virgil Vandagriff, who later worked on the case, told <a href=#>Indianapolis Monthly</a>.&nbsp;"Police didn't have a clue what was going on at the restaurant. They kind of messed up the crime scene."</p><p dir=ltr>It was two days after their kidnapping that the bodies of the four victims were found, but by then, it was too late. Any evidence that investigators might have gleaned from the Burger Chef had already been contaminated.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2Fkmlpam1frLW6edOhnGaapae0pr6MnJ%2Benl2iwrOwxKuqZquknrmtecearZ6mpGKvprHNZqqopKaasXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
