Stevie Nicks and ‘Rhiannon’ Rumors began to circulate about Nicks being a witch after the release of Fleetwood Mac’s “Rhiannon” in 1976. According to Stephen Davis, author of Gold Dust Woman, Nicks would sometimes start the song during concerts by saying, “This is a song about an old Welsh witch."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I just wear black because it makes me look thinner, you idiots.’”</p><h2 id=h-is-stevie-nicks-a-witch-the-singer-says-no>Is Stevie Nicks a witch?

At one point, she says the witch rumors bothered her so much she stopped wearing black. However, Nicks resolved to stop being afraid of what others thought, and she went back to her signature look.</p><p id=par-5_60>“I stopped wearing black for like a year,” says Nicks in her Los Angeles Times interview. “Then I was just like, ‘OK, just bring it freaks. I’m not going to wear apricot. You think whatever you want because I’m going to wear my beautiful, long black dress. Get out of my face.’ I got mad. I went back to black.”</p><h2 id=h-stevie-nicks-dark-style>Stevie Nicks’ dark style</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_86>People continued to accuse Nicks of being a witch not only because of the way she dressed but also the way she performed onstage. Former Interview magazine journalist Ray Rogers described the singer as “straddling the spirit world and the rock-n-roll world” (via <a href=#>fleetwoodmac-uk.com</a>). Nicks often wore long, black skirts or dresses, platform boots, a black top hat, and a dark shawl or black blouses with long, chiffon sleeves. She is known to dance around in her black outfits as if communicating with an unseen being.</p><p id=par-7_38>Nicks told Interview magazine that mysticism has always been <a href=#>part of her work and style</a>. She says she dresses the way she does because “twirling around in chiffon” is fun. She also wants to have a “mystical presence.”</p><p id=par-8_48>“Having a little bit of the spiritual is ultimately better than having none,” says Nicks in her discussion with Interview magazine. “For me, the whole idea of twirling around in chiffon onstage is a whole lot more fun than standing there in a straight dress that doesn’t move.”</p><p id=par-9_74>Nicks made a conscious decision to incorporate mysticism into her life and work. “A long, long time ago, I decided I was going to have a kind of mystical presence, so I made my clothes, my boots, my hair, and my whole being go with that. But it wasn’t something I just made up at that point. It’s the way I’ve always been. I’ve always believed in good witches–not bad witches–and fairies and angels.”</p><p id=par-10_5>Follow Sheiresa Ngo on <a href=#>Twitter</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAtbHVopxmppmYuLR50pqwrGWjnbJutdJmpaisXZZ6uLXTnJ9noKSiuXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
