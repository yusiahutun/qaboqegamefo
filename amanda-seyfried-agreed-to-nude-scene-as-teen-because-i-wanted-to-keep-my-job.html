She admits she came up pretty "unscathed," but that doesn't mean there weren't some uncomfortable moments along the way.</p><p>She recalled on particular incident, without offering details. "Being 19, walking around without my underwear on – like, are you kidding me? How did I let that happen?"</p><p>Then, after a beat, she answered her own question. "Oh, I know why: I was 19 and I didn’t want to upset anybody, and I wanted to keep my job. That’s why."</p><p>The actress said that this was a huge motivating factor for her throughout her 20s. She didn't have the confidence to believe that she could become famous or recognized for her work. She just wanted to ensure she always had a steady stream of it.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:c03f92b2-46ea-4e26-80d6-884f90d99bb5 data-container-ref=toofab:article:9890e942-971c-4855-9db0-87bc4e876e9b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/fb/5by4/2022/08/04/fb20001d1a8e49dda06f081c4cbe2cd3_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Melanie Lynskey Was Body-Shamed While Filming Coyote Ugly: 'I Was Already Starving Myself'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Now, she's receiving career-high accolades for her transformative performance in "The Dropout" as real-life Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes on the heels of a 2021 Oscar nomination for her work in another biopic, "Mank."</p><p>"It’s kind of surreal that we’re here now, that we got nominated, and I got nominated; I got singled out. I didn’t spend any part of my career singled out, ever," Seyfriend said, adding that she had "no expectation of being singled out, and that’s partly my self-deprecating nature. Never expecting anything great, preparing for the worst, but just continuing to walk on my path."</p><p>While much of her career was spent playing characters that she said weren't too much of a stretch from who she is naturally, Seyfried said these two roles pushed her in new ways. "I want to be a character actor and I want to play different people," she said.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:1bd25329-ede4-4e01-a733-c74527a3cd3b data-container-ref=toofab:article:9890e942-971c-4855-9db0-87bc4e876e9b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d1/5by4/2022/08/08/d1d0f67e777c4a769586cc869543732d_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Sean Bean Believes Intimacy Coordinators 'Spoil the Spontaneity' of Filming Sex Scenes</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Seyfried's comments about modern-day intimacy coordinators comes on the heels of <a href=#>"Game of Thrones"</a> and "Snowpiercer" star <a href=#>Sean Bean</a> propelling them back into the media spotlight after he criticized them, saying they can "ruin" sex scenes and "spoil the spontaneity" by taking away "the natural way lovers behave."</p><p>Many came forward in criticism of Bean's comments, with the most common refrain being that it's actors jobs to make tings that are "a technical exercise" look natural. "West Side Story" star Rachel Zegler said it's about establishing "an environment of safety for actors."</p><p>Even his "Snowpiercer" co-star Lena Hall, who shared an intimate scene with the actor, stood up for intimacy coordinators. While she said she was completely comfortable around Bean in that scene, she noted that "if there is any part of me that is feeling weird, gross, over exposed etc… I will either challenge the necessity of the scene or I’ll want an [intimacy coordinator]."</p><a id=gallery-link-88dfa266-3272-4c63-95b6-dd0f9726e13e class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:88dfa266-3272-4c63-95b6-dd0f9726e13e data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:9890e942-971c-4855-9db0-87bc4e876e9b data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/4b/4by3/2022/08/08/4ba4d42a91f84a1da719fea17773da5c_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j3FmaXFflrqiusOaZKydqZu%2FqrHDZpigqpWasW7AzmalrpyVYsCksc2eZJqrXamyprqMm5ycmaWosm61jLCYp6yVmXq1u4yknJ6oXaLGbrbOm2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
