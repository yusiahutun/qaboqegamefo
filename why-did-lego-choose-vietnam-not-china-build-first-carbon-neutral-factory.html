Government statistics show that industries and services account for 97 per cent of the province’s economic output.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Already home to 30 industrial estates, Binh Duong is determined to keep the momentum going. In 2022, the province’s biggest industrial estate developer began constructing its seventh estate, spanning 1,000 hectares. It is here where Lego’s new factory is being built.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2022/12/14/CLEAN.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:34</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Inflation in the West forces Vietnam factory lay-offs</p><p>Inflation in the West forces Vietnam factory lay-offs</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But despite similar choices by many companies to branch out their manufacturing operations, industry insiders say that Vietnam alone cannot supplant China as the so-called world’s factory. However, Vietnam is still ramping up the competition with China, which has been the main destination for international manufacturing investment in recent decades.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That competition is only expected to intensify as both the Chinese and Vietnamese governments vie to attract higher-quality foreign investors with various incentives. And they’re not alone. With the whole of Southeast Asia looking to carve out a piece of China’s manufacturing pie, analysts say China will be hard-pressed to maintain its once-undisputed dominance in the long run.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The deluge of investments and shifting of supply chains from China to Vietnam in recent years has indeed triggered concerns within China about losing manufacturing business to Vietnam.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Vietnam began receiving more attention from foreign investors in 2018 after the US-China trade war broke out and Washington imposed higher tariffs on manufacturers with operations in China. FDI into Vietnam increased by 9.1 per cent to US$19.1 billion in 2018, followed by a 6.7 per cent increase to US$20.38 billion in 2019. Investment from China and Hong Kong to Vietnam jumped by a particularly high margin that year, with 165 and 24o per cent increases, respectively.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Is China’s place as the world’s factory under threat from Vietnam?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That interest further increased when massive Covid-19 lockdowns disrupted production in Chinese factories. While the global pandemic initially stalled FDI inflow into Vietnam in 2020, investment aggressively flowed in again in 2021 with US$38.85 billion worth of newly registered FDI.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But while such factors have made Vietnam – and the wider Southeast Asian region – more attractive to investors, observers said China’s vast area, population and domestic market, along with Vietnam’s relatively underdeveloped manufacturing sector and lower-skilled workers, meant China’s status as the world’s factory would not be challenged.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Compared with Guangdong, China’s most populous and prosperous province and a key manufacturing hub in the south of the country, Vietnam has substantially more land – roughly 310,000 sq km (120,000 square miles) versus 180,000 sq km – but Vietnam’s GDP was less than a fifth as big in 2021 and its population is around 80 per cent of Guangdong’s.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That same year, China accounted for 30 per cent of global manufacturing output, while Vietnam was responsible for just 0.05 per cent.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“My expectation is that, so long as FDI flows in and workers are available, a slice of China’s exports will move to Vietnam. But this is limited in many ways,” said David Dapice, a senior economist with the Vietnam and Myanmar programmes at Harvard University’s Ash Centre for Democratic Governance and Innovation. “With 7 per cent of China’s population, [Vietnam] will not be able to displace more than a small fraction of China’s exports.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zhang Monan, deputy director of the Institute of American and European Studies at the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges in Beijing, said countries need a complete industrial system and huge domestic market to be able to serve as the world’s workshop, and those criteria put Vietnam at a disadvantage in replacing China.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The lack of an independent and complete industrial chain means that, for Vietnam, parts and semi-finished products are mainly supplied from China, and finished products are mainly sold to the United States – a model that Zhang said makes Vietnam’s industrial development highly dependent on foreign trade.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Maya Xiao, a senior analyst at Interact Analysis, a market research company based in the United Kingdom, said the processing of only a few links in the whole manufacturing process in Vietnam contrasts with the complete manufacturing industry ecology that has been built up in China.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">Vietnam should be wise and carefully select the kind of investment they want to attractBruno Jaspaert, Deep C</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Vietnam also lacks an abundance of skilled workers, relative to China. According to the Vietnamese government, 11 per cent of the country’s 51.4-million-strong labour force is considered highly skilled, whereas China says it has more than 200 million skilled workers, accounting for roughly 26 per cent of its total labour force.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s impossible for Vietnam to become the world’s factory,” said Bruno Jaspaert, CEO of Deep C Industrial Zones, one of Vietnam’s biggest industrial zone developers, in Haiphong. “That is why Vietnam should be wise and carefully select the kind of investment they want to attract and be very, very creative in the way they want to attract it, because they will soon run out of people, energy and land that China will never run out of.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Raising the quality of FDI has been on the Vietnamese government’s agenda since 2019, when the Communist Party of Vietnam’s Politburo issued a resolution calling on the country to attract more hi-tech and green technologies that add greater value in the production process.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Known as Resolution 50, it also touched on improving the quality of Vietnam’s labour force, with an ambitious aim to increase the percentage of skilled workers to 80 per cent by 2030.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2022/11/01/WEBCLEAN-XiVietnam.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:42</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Xi Jinping says China will build stable supply chain with Vietnam</p><p>Xi Jinping says China will build stable supply chain with Vietnam</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, a report issued by the Vietnam Association of Foreign Invested Enterprises in May said progress had been slow, with not enough hi-tech projects from the US and Europe attracted in 2021.</p>But Vietnam’s late arrival to the party, at a time when green energy and manufacturing are becoming increasingly important for exporters to European markets because of new European Union agreements such as the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism</span></a>, which will levy additional taxes based on carbon emissions during manufacturing, could prove a boon.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jaspaert said Vietnam “may have the recipe for success” if it focuses on issues such as sustainability, the United Nations development goals and environmental, social and governance criteria that are important to international investors.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Also because for them, since they are only starting now, incorporating all of those new criteria and taking it into your new infrastructure is quite easy,” he said. “If you have a country that has been developed completely, and you have to start thinking of doing that … the costs are enormous. So, I think Vietnam is lucky in both timing and momentum at this moment.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Made in Mexico?

So, Le said, China could end up focusing on higher-end services, while Southeast Asia could play a bigger role as a manufacturing hub more focused on the lower and middle parts of the spectrum.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Of course, in a way, it is a competition, because China loses some of its investors to Vietnam and some other countries,” he said. “But I think that is how the economy works and how the market works. When you are not competitive enough, and you are not attractive to investors any more, they will leave you.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The same thing may happen to Vietnam sooner or later … If Vietnam is no longer attractive, investors can move to Cambodia, Myanmar, Bangladesh or India.
