Her family is over 6,500 miles (10,500km) away in Canada – and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Hong Kong’s Covid-19 restrictions</span></a> have put a strain on international travel.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Instead, Carol Chan – Richard’s pui jyut, or confinement nanny – came to live with her during her first post-partum month to guide her.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Having an experienced woman around helping me to heal, as well as teaching me how to care for my baby, sounded wonderful. I was also very curious about the traditional and cultural aspects … I wanted to learn about and experience everything myself.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At its core, Chinese confinement is about replenishing the mother after childbirth. Translated directly from the Chinese co jyut zi or “sitting the moon/month”, it is the period during which a new mother simply “sits” or rests and recovers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Childbirth depletes womens’ physical strength and leaves them in a state of ‘insufficient blood and qi deficiency’ after labour,” Chan says. “But they can regain their original constitution through confinement.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/09/05/3f85d8eb-7190-40de-bed5-aa65e15b94a7_89066a05.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is a rigorous process: no working, no household chores, no washing your hair, use ginger water for bathing, no bare feet, no cold foods, no using air conditioners or fans – a struggle in Hong Kong summers – and no going outside.</p>In <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">traditional Chinese medicine</span></a>, the eyes are connected to the liver and, in turn, breast milk production so there are rules specifically regarding the eyes, too: no crying, no reading – and no watching screens or technology.The tradition has been controversial.

For example, since the weather is hot and temperatures go up to nearly 40 degrees Celsius, it doesn’t make sense to keep the air-con off.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I cried quite a bit,” says Richard. “I’d often just be scrolling on my phone, or editing videos secretly in my room – because you’re not supposed to work! But she knew what I was doing, it was fine.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/09/05/9faece0e-b3b9-4f70-bd92-860433988bfb_bd32ac91.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Food plays a large part in the daily rhythm of Chinese confinement. Herbs and medicines are chosen for their various properties, all aimed at boosting milk supply, blood circulation, relieving pain or reducing water retention.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I found it challenging to drink all of the teas and soups,” says Richard. “It’s a lot of liquid after eating full meals!”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sang faa tong is one of the most popular confinement drinks, made from a mix of root vegetables including ginseng. But it is not for everyone.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“[It] was the worst thing I’ve ever drank – so bitter!

I was feeding my baby every two hours or so, consuming the many foods, teas and soups, doing the many practices, spending quality bonding time with my newborn, and learning everything I could about being a mother,” says Richard. “I was ‘confined’ to my home, but I wasn’t bored at all because Carol kept my schedule packed.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even so, when Richard shared the confinement process with her followers, the reaction was mixed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“No crying seems impossible,” said one commenter, while others said the binding process “looks painful” or is “not a good method”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">You’re a new Hong Kong mum.

The cost to have her available for 24 hours a day is more than double that. And an experienced nanny can charge up to HK$80,000 a month for round-the-clock service.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/09/05/89a791e0-02b6-470c-b3f9-5fd597529bd3_d76cdb00.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They can only do several contracts a year and get booked up fast,” Richard says. “There’s a joke that some women call their pui jyut as soon as they know they’re pregnant, even before telling their husband!”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Karen Lai is one such mother.
