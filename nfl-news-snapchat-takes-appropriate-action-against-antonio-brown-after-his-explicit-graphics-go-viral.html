However, his distinction turned into notoriety as a result of his contentious antics. Even after leaving the league, Brown was not exempt from scandals. The latest incident involved him uploading sexually inappropriate graphics of Chelsie Kyriss.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Antonio Brown gets derailed off Snapchat</h2><p>After AB’s antics went viral, Snapchat took the matter into its own hands. As per TMZ, Brown’s <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Snapchat account was taken down</a> after he uploaded an explicit picture of his children’s mother, Chelsie Kyriss. The former NFL wide receiver’s account was frozen by the social media platform since they&nbsp;strictly reject “sexually explicit content and bullying or harassment of any kind.”</p><p><span>Antonio Brown’s Snapchat antics were going overboard. He began the jab fest by taking a jab at <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Tom Brady</a> after posting a photoshopped image of Gisele Bündchen. He edited the supermodel’s face into the body of a woman. But AB may have crossed the limits with his actions.</span></p><p><span>The latest incident surrounding him is like a downright ugly scenario that could land Antonio Brown in trouble. The former athlete already&nbsp;</span><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><span>had an arrest warrant</span></a><span> in the past. But this time, he is standing on thin ice.</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Chelsie Kyriss responds to AB’s shameful antics</h2><p>As Antonio Brown’s tactics took social media by storm, Chelsie Kyriss spoke out over the entire controversy. The mother of AB’s kids took to Instagram Stories and expressed her thoughts on the situation. She initially said that Snapchat did not remove Brown’s inappropriate material from the platform.</p><p>Chelsie Kyriss said, “I have asked multiple times to have this part of our past relationship to remain private but he refuses. I have reported his page and all pictures unfortunately Snapchat is allowing him to repost.” After her statement, Snapchat handled the matter after suspending his account.</p><p>Nevertheless, AB’s time on the social media platform seems to be over, but his antics may not stop anytime soon.</p><p><strong>Watch This Story:</strong> <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Tom Brady Went to The Same High School As This Controversial MLB Hall of Famer Who Was Also A 14x All-Star</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue82fo2amlazAbr%2FNmqecoJGperWtyp6qZpmgpb%2BwvNGimK2dXZawtbXOp2San5Geu7TAjJqlraeenrxurtGorqdlkZvBpr6MoaCsZZWtva21wqKrZp%2Bilr2ptcKsZKCnXau2s63LaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
