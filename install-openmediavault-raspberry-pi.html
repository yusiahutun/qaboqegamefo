OpenMediaVault is one such free home server solution that, when paired with the Raspberry Pi, creates an affordable server in your own home.</p><h2 id=what-is-openmediavault>What Is OpenMediaVault?</h2><p>OpenMediaVault was originally created as a network attached storage solution. Thanks to a simple interface you can perform much of the required server administration from any device (with a web browser) in your home.</p><p>As long as the web browser is on the same home network as your Raspberry Pi, you have the ability to add users, set up file sharing, install certificates (SSH and SSL), spin up docker containers, and review your server's performance from the comfort of your laptop or tablet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-you-39-ll-need>What You'll Need</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/raspberry-pi-4.jpg><p>Make sure you have the following items before starting to set up your home server on your Raspberry Pi.</p><ul><li>Raspberry Pi 4 (recommended)</li><li>Storage<ul><li>SD Card (Base installation: 8GB; up to 256GB for additional storage)</li><li>Additional Storage (External SSD/M.2 via USB) is recommended</li></ul></li><li>Monitor (during the initial installation)</li><li>HDMI to micro-HDMI cable</li><li>Ethernet outlet and cable</li><li>Power supply (ensure the power supply is capable of powering your Raspberry Pi and external storage)</li><li>Keyboard and mouse</li></ul><h2 id=installing-openmediavault>Installing OpenMediaVault</h2><p>First, you'll need to install Raspberry Pi Lite OS on the SD card you wish to use with your Raspberry Pi. The easiest way to do that is by using the Raspberry Pi installer. Using Linux, open up a terminal and type:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><pre><code class="hljs sql">sudo apt <span class=hljs-keyword>install</span> rpi-imager (Debian)</code> </pre><pre><code class="hljs sql">sudo snap <span class=hljs-keyword>install</span> rpi-imager (other Linux distributions)</code> </pre><p>Alternatively, you can use this guide for help with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">installing Raspberry Pi Lite OS</a> from any operating system. Make sure to select Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-Bit). Follow along with the intuitive prompts and relax. This will take a few minutes to complete.</p><p>As you go through the installation process, ensure that you select the advanced options in order to set a hostname and enable SSH. Setting a hostname is easier than having to memorize your IP address and an SSH connection will be required when you'll access your Raspberry Pi terminal remotely. When you set a username and password take extra care to remember this information.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/raspberry-pi-installer-set-up.jpg><p>When the installation is complete the Raspberry Pi will come to a log in screen (this is where the monitor comes in handy).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pi-log-in-screen.jpg><p>Enter your username and password you created during the initial installation. When you're logged in, it's a good practice to update the newly installed operating system, reveal the Raspberry Pi IP address, and installing the OpenMediaVault software.</p><p>Most operating system images that are bundled with installers do not come with the latest updates. It's easy to ensure that you're up-to-date with the following instructions. As well, enter your password when prompted:</p><pre><code class="hljs xml">sudo apt <span class=hljs-keyword>update</span> &amp;&amp; sudo apt <span class=hljs-keyword>upgrade</span><br></code> </pre><p>Now, you'll need to find your IP address. Type in either of the following commands:</p><pre><code class=hljs>ip addr</code> </pre><pre><code class=hljs>ifconfig</code> </pre><p>You'll find your IP address under the <strong>eth0</strong> section and beside <strong>inet</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the nearby computer, open up a terminal (or similar program) and type SSH user@IP Address (replace user with the username you created during the initial installation and the IP.Address with the IP address revealed moments ago. For help with connecting to your Raspberry Pi remotely, take a look at our <a href=#>SSH into Raspberry Pi walk-through</a> for details.</p><p>Now that you have the foundation of your Raspberry Pi server set up and ready, it's now time to install OpenMediaVault.</p><p>In the same application that you connected to your Raspberry Pi remotely via SSH type the following command:</p><pre><code class="hljs javascript">sudo wget -O - https:<span class=hljs-comment>//github.com/OpenMediaVault-Plugin-Developers/installScript/raw/master/install | sudo bash</span></code> </pre><p>Once prompted, enter your password to continue. This will take up to 10 minutes to complete. When this activity is completed, you should see a screen similar to the one in the image.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/OMV-6-log-in-terminal-screenshot--obfuscated.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When your Raspberry Pi finishes rebooting, the IP address may have changed. You can either write down the new IP address (if it changed for you), or type raspberrypi.local in the address bar of the web browser at your remote computer.</p><p>Take note of the default username (admin) and the default password (openmediavault) shared in the log-in greeting. This is very important. After you enter the IP address of your Raspberry Pi (or raspberrypi.local) into your computer's web browser, you will see a log in screen.</p><h2 id=customizing-your-server>Customizing Your Server</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fancy-omv-login.jpg><p>Now, type in the default username and password to log in to your server! You'll be greeted with a dashboard that requires setting up. But, first be sure to change the default password. To do so, click on the person icon at the top right of the main OpenMediaVault screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The included dashboard includes monitoring information for your CPU, memory, containers, file systems, services, network interfaces, and other diagnostic tools.
