The former <a href=#>Fixer Upper</a> stars live in a stunning Victorian-style residence in Crawford, Texas, which is a suburb of <a href=#>Waco</a>.</p><p>Chip and Joanna purchased the 1,700-square-foot property in 2012. The longtime lovebirds spent over a year-and-a-half renovating the space, but they settled into their new digs in October 2013. The dwelling, which sits on over 40 acres of land, has been since nicknamed “The Farmhouse.”</p><p>Before they made the house their dream home, the property only featured two bedrooms. However, Chip and Jo’s brilliant renovation made their home big enough for <a href=#>their five kids</a>, <a href=#>Drake</a>, <a href=#>Ella Rose</a>, <a href=#>Duke</a>, <a href=#>Emmie Kay</a> and <a href=#>Crew</a>. The abode also has three bathrooms, a country-style kitchen, various sitting rooms, a craft room and more.</p><p>Aside from their jaw-dropping house, the renovation gurus’ property features tons of open land for their kids to run around and play. They also have chicken coops, farms, gardens, a greenhouse and more. By the looks of Chip and Jo’s Instagram pages, they love spending time outdoors with their family.</p><p>The Magnolia owners may have a lot on their plate when it comes to their many projects, but the proud parents will always choose their kiddos over their careers. “For the record: If there’s ever a need with my family, I’ll shut this circus down so fast it will make your head spin,” <a href=#>Chip told USA Today</a> in 2018. “But Jo and I believe that with God, anything is possible, including having an amazing family and a career you love.”</p><p>At the time, a source close to the dynamic duo — who tied the knot in 2003 — revealed they’re willing to do anything to protect Drake, Ella Rose, Duke, Emmie Kay and Crew. “<a href=#>Being good parents</a> is Chip and Joanna’s first priority,” the insider told Closer Weekly. A separate source also told Closer that the key to Chip and Jo’s happy life is spending “<a href=#>quality time” at home with their children</a>.</p><p>“They always eat meals together at the table and their family nights include games like cards and checkers, then bedtime stories and prayers,” the insider shared in 2019. “In this house, mom’s rules include no cell phones or TV, homework first then play and no computers after 6 p.m. In the evening, the kids kick back by reading each other stories. Everyone says they have the perfect life.”</p><p>It sure sounds like they do!</p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to see photos inside Chip and Jo’s Waco home.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn56qlWKxsHnCoaCpZZGjsW62zpqlp5ldnK6qusSsZKWhppp6sbTOraasZZ%2Bberitwqhkoaedmnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
