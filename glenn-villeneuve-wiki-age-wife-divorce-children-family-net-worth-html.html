Take things slow and enjoy the process rather than being fixed on the goal, because you never know exactly how things are going to unfold.</p><p style=text-align:justify>His family of five have featured in the&nbsp;National Geographic series,&nbsp;Life Below Zero.&nbsp;Glenn and his partner Trisha move their kids from a cabin in Fairbanks to the hut in Brook Ranges in the low temperature of Alaska.
