Um, everyone’s hot but in an interesting way,” in a video posted on Thursday, November 17. Ratajkowski’s post comes just three days after Us Weekly <a href=#>confirmed that she is dating the 29-year-old comedian</a> after they were introduced by a mutual friend.</p><p>“Pete and Emily have been talking for a couple months now,” a source exclusively told Us on Monday, November 14, adding that the twosome are “in the very early stages, but both really like each other. <a href=#>Pete makes Emily laugh and he loves how intelligent she is</a>.”</p><p>Two days later, <a href=#>the pair were photographed together for the first time</a> outside of the Gone Girl actress’ New York apartment. In photos obtained by Page Six, Ratajkowski — who appears to be holding a birthday gift in one hand — can be seen hugging the Saturday Night Live alum before they headed into her building.</p><p>Prior to her relationship with Davidson, the “High/Low” podcast host — who <a href=#>filed for divorce from producer <strong>Sebastian Bear-McClard</strong></a> in September — <a href=#>seemingly came out as bisexual via TikTok in October.</a> “If you identify as bisexual, do you own a green velvet couch?” TikTok user @NourishedWithTish says in the video, which was originally reposted by <a href=#><strong>Shay Mitchell</strong></a>. Ratajkowski reshared the 35-year-old Pretty Little Liars star’s post on her own account, adding a clip where she showed her own green sofa to the camera before grinning.</p><p>Following her split from Bear-McClard, 35, <a href=#>with whom she shares 21-month-old son Sylvester</a>, the We Are Your Friends actress opened up about enjoying the dating scene for the first time in her life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Emily-Ratajkowski-Subtly-Reacts-to-Tweet-About-Pete-Davidson-Storied-Dating-History-Sebastian-Bear-McClard.jpg><p>“<a href=#>I can tell you that I have never been single before</a>,” Ratajkowski told Harper’s Bazaar in October. “I feel all the emotions. I feel anger, sadness. I feel excitement. I feel joy. I feel levity. Every day is different. The only good thing I know is that I’m feeling all those things, which is nice because it makes me believe that I’ll be OK.”</p><p>The London native went on to explain that <a href=#>she’s taking a new approach to finding love this time around</a>. “To use the TikTok phrase, I was a bit of a ‘pick-me girl’ in the sense that I wasn’t very good at deciding what I liked,” she explained at the time. “I really wanted to be chosen. <a href=#>It was hard for me to go on a date with someone</a> and think about how much I did or didn’t like them. I would have been thinking about how they were perceiving me, what it meant, what they wanted from me, what it meant about my self-worth.”</p><p>Ratajkowski continued: “I don’t have that anymore. So now it’s really fun to go to dinner with someone and be like, ‘Cool. I really enjoyed these parts of them. I really didn’t like these other parts.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Dealing-With-Major-Challenges-Pete-Davidson-Makes-His-1st-Onscreen-Appearance-on-The-Kardashians.jpg><p>Davidson, for his part, <a href=#>has been in a number of high-profile relationships during his time</a> in the spotlight.

Us confirmed in August that he and the Skims CEO, 42, called it quits after less than a year of dating.</p><p>“<a href=#>There truly wasn’t drama between them</a> when they decided to separate,” a source exclusively told Us at the time. “They had a lot of fun together and they can look back with fond memories.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaepZmhxm6%2BwK2Yo6OfrMCstYyhoKeso2KutXnOqZynZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXq4tdOhZKmdpJp6pa3Vopusp55k</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
