It was a challenging road for me, the baby-making road.” She talked about her multiple attempts to have a baby, and how the time was especially “hard.” “I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it. I would’ve given anything if someone had said to me, ‘Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.’” However, she mainly had a problem with the media and the ongoing “narrative that I was just selfish.” She continued, “I just cared about my career. And God forbid a woman is successful and doesn’t have a child. And the reason my husband left me, why we broke up and ended our marriage, was because I wouldn’t give him a kid. It was absolute lies. I don’t have anything to hide at this point.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>RELATED: Here’s How to Score Invites to Movie Premieres & Meet All Your Fave Celebs</strong></a></p><p>The pair met in 1994 but didn’t date until 1998 when their agents set them up.

This decision is the result of much thoughtful consideration. We happily remain committed and caring friends with great love and admiration for one another. We ask in advance for your kindness and sensitivity in the coming months.”</p><p>Jennifer later moved on to marry Justin Theroux from 2015 to 2017, while Brad was married to Angelina Jolie from 2014 to 2019.

According to Jennifer, the pair are very happy being friends. “It was absolutely fun. Brad and I are buddies, we’re friends,” the Cake&nbsp;actress said. “And we speak, and there’s no oddness at all, except for everyone that probably watched it and was wanting there to be, or assumed there to be.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Watch-This-Space.png alt='"Watch This Space" - Amazon Prime Video' width=670 height=155 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><span class=s1>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
