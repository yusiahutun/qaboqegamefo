And no, we're not talking about an iPhone, Cabbage Patch Kids, or even Jordans, but a gift famously recorded in the Bible: frankincense.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The aromatic and medicinal compound that likely signaled luxury way back then (the word "frankincense" itself springs from Anglo-French "franc" — as in expensive — and "encens" or incense), remains a costly commodity that's growing in popularity. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Market price</a> for a kilo of frankincense (boswellia) essential oil runs in the hundreds while <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>market research</a> shows revenue is expected to double in the next decade.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">What may have been the original fragrance gift bestowed long before the creation of eau de parfums, frankincense has also developed an enduring legacy as a valuable botanical in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Ayurvedic medicine</a> (as seen in early medical texts Charaka Samhita, circa 700 B.C.; and Susruta Samhita, circa 600 B.C.). More recently, frankincense-derived acids, essential oils, and resins have started popped up in a range of skincare formulations that span eye creams, sheet masks, serums, body oils, and so much more.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Credit the ingredient's upswing in beauty to our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>insatiable appetite</a> for "natural" skincare and references in research that point to its <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>anti-inflammatory</a> properties and ability to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>improve skin elasticity</a> or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>decrease sebum excretion</a>. In fact, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel=nofollow>Allison Audrey Weldon</a>, founder of Sangre de Fruta, explains that in the old world, frankincense was valued like gold, so much so that it is often referred to as the king of essential oils — or liquid gold. But no matter how popular frankincense becomes, dermatologists say it's not enough to go all-in on the ingredient as a first-line treatment. That's because for a botanical that's been in the collective consciousness for ages, frankincense's skin benefits are surprisingly under researched.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Ayurvedic medicine has existed for thousands of years and there are benefits to this approach to health, but there are no published studies examining the benefits of boswellia or frankincense on the skin. None," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dr. Melanie Palm</a>, a San Diego-area dermatologist. "This is not to say there couldn't be benefits of frankincense, but know that any of these skincare products assertions are not supported by large or well-designed clinical studies to prove a beneficial effect on the skin."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, the age-old botanical may prove something of an up-and-comer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There has been anecdotal evidence that frankincense and boswellia applied topically have helped with skin inflammation and can be beneficial for patients with skin disorders like eczema," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dr. Orit Markowitz</a>, a dermatologist in New York City and associate professor of dermatology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. "However, other than this anecdotal evidence that shows these ingredients being used as an anti-inflammatory, there is no other scientific data that supports other claims."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dr. Marisa K. Garshick</a>, a Manhattan-based dermatologist, says that frankincense incorporates terpenes, which detoxifies and controls sebum levels in the skin. As such, it can benefit people with oily and acne-prone skin. She also notes that frankincense increases skin elasticity, improve signs of photoaging, and promotes skin firmness.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dr. Raja Sivamani</a>, an integrative dermatologist and Ayurvedic practitioner who serves as director of clinical research at University of California, Davis, sees additional potential in the ingredient used for skin care, noting, "It is true that boswellia will have antioxidant properties. But we need to put them to the clinical test on their antioxidant properties specifically."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While dermatologic research plays catch up, skincare brands continue to include the ingredient to calm and protect skin — and that's not likely to wane anytime soon.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though cosmetic chemist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Ni'Kita Wilson</a> says she, herself, seldom uses frankincense ingredients when developing skincare products for her clients (which include Fortune 500 companies and indie brands), she thinks we will continue to see more of them in our beauty products.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The most common form [of frankincense ingredient] available is boswellia serrata, which has supplier studies that show soothing and anti-inflammatory benefits," she says. "It's a natural ingredient that can denote health and comfort; I can definitely see the use increasing over time."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It may have taken millenia for frankincense to trend in skincare, but despite its natural derivation and spiritual significance, our pros say the ingredient should be introduced to a self-care routine with measure. "It is very important to understand your skin type and tendencies," Dr. Sivamani says. "Check with a dermatologist to make sure your skin can safely tolerate this ingredient before working with an Ayurvedic practitioner or a naturopathic doctor to explore botanicals more deeply."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For those looking to reap its aromatherapeutic benefits, a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>2016 study</a> supports the claim that frankincense has a soothing effect and provides people with a sense of calm. "[It's] bright and woody, musty, and metallic — a true old-world aroma that has the ability to comfort the mood," says Weldon. Those interested should consider using an essential oil diffuser with a few drops of frankincense in locations such as the bedroom.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Turns Out, Using a Gua Sha on Your Scalp Can Promote Healthy Hair Growth</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If your skin responds well to one of the most renowned Christmas gifts on record, find 10 ways to incorporate it to your routine, below.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>Neal's Yard Remedies Intense Lift Serum</b></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Get your daily dose of free radical fighters via the proprietary frankincense complex in this serum, which contains boswellic acid and polyphenols, which has been found to guard collagen, according to the brand's own study.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To shop: $115; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>credobeauty.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>Vintner's Daughter Active Botanical Serum</b></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Frankincense is just one of 22 botanical actives in this oil-based serum, which boasts some 60-plus vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients, antioxidants, phytoceramides, aminos, and omega fatty acids.

What's more, the oil-based formula may be best suited to capitalize on frankincense's efficacy.
