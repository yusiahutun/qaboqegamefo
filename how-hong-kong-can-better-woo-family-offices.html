One of the reports on this development mentioned banks facing more scrutiny after a money-laundering scandal in Singapore.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Family offices are not new but seem to be burgeoning in the last decade and the financial sector is obsessed with the label. Hong Kong scrapped estate duty many years ago and family wealth succession arrangements are no longer tax planning-oriented but focused on protection of asset value and fair distribution among family members. Today, this is linked to investment management for one family or groups of families, hence the emergence of multifamily offices, which is another fancy label that makes little difference to what private bankers have been doing for the rich and famous for years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While concerns about money laundering related to family offices should be addressed by the regulators, the Hong Kong government should continue to think about ways to keep family offices operating here. A tax-free zone next to the airport could help encourage family offices to set up headquarters here permanently. In addition, a medical tourism hub near the airport could attract wealthy families to conveniently access our private hospital services. Our insurance industry would definitely thank our government for this.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Joseph Chan, chairman, Silk Road Economic Development Research Centre</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Don’t compromise on customs checks for the wealthy</h3>I refer to <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">the report</span></a>, “Private jet fliers welcome option of fast-track transfers” (April 28). The idea that wealthy passengers flying into and transiting through Hong Kong International Airport are now able to pay for the convenience of avoiding individually handling the “complicated and time-consuming process of customs and immigration clearance” is worrying.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kvLG1zaKmp2ecmsG1sdGsZpqqpJ6wrbGObGlvaWFng3C0zrBkoaeenHqsu82gZJyZnmKvpsDTnqlmr5%2BkeqetzKKjsmWfm7Oqr8Ss</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
