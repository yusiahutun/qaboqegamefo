He climbed the mountain top once again.&nbsp;</p><p>“We have a small family. No cousins. One aunt and one uncle. It was really my brother and I our whole lives. We did almost everything together. Competing, fought, laughed, cried and learned from each other.&nbsp;</p><p>“We invented games, imagined ourselves as the star players of that time. We envisioned making the game winning plays, day after day. We won countless Super Bowls in our minds before ever leaving the house. And when we weren’t playing, we were at the other one’s games.&nbsp;</p><p>“Butt seated in a long chair or bench, a Capri Sun in our hands that mom had packed, cheering during the game and waiting outside and afterward to celebrate a victory together or offer encouragement after a defeat.</p><p>“There is no chance I’d be here without the bond that Travis and I share.

I knew it right away.</p><p>“I think it’s no coincidence I have enjoyed the best years of my career with Kylie by my side. Every accolade I have ever received in my life has come with her in my life.&nbsp;</p><p>“She has brought the best out of me through love, devotion, support, honesty, intelligence, and of course a swift kick in the a** from time to time. She has also given me three beautiful girls in a life that increasingly brings me more fulfilment off the field than it does on. We’ve had a great run, Ky.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jason-kelce-s-career-with-the-philadelphia-eagles>Jason Kelce’s career with the Philadelphia Eagles</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-2058870568.jpg><p>Kelce was a sixth-round pick out of Cincinnati in the 2011 draft, and went on to win the Super Bowl with the team in 2018 against the New England Patriots.</p><p>In 2017, at the Super Bowl parade, he gave a rousing speech to fans, dressed as one of Philadelphia’s famed Mummers, telling the crowd there was “no one like us!”</p><p>The parade still has a special place in his heart as he brought it up in his speech yesterday.</p><p>He said: “I won’t forget the parade and what it meant to the city of Philadelphia.
