That’s right, there are all sorts of beliefs and practices that could be jinxing you without you even realizing it. Fear not, because we’ve got you covered! We’ve put together a list of both well-known and obscure situations that might be bringing bad (or good) luck your way. So, sit back, <a href=#>relax</a>, and get ready to learn all about the fascinating world of Middle Eastern superstitions!</p><p class="ez-toc-title ez-toc-toggle">Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content"><span class=ez-toc-js-icon-con><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></span></a></span><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Spilling_Coffee></span>Spilling Coffee<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Well, believe it or not, spilling coffee in the Middle East is actually a blessing in disguise! It’s said to bring good luck to both the clumsy spiller and the area that’s been drenched in the hot liquid. Although it may cause burns and unsightly stains that are hard to scrub off, it’s all worth it for the good fortune it brings.</p><p>Arabs consider it so lucky that they frequently gamble after spilling coffee in the hopes of cashing in on their good fortune. As the old proverb goes, “Better safe than sorry.” It’s no secret that, depending on where you live, the legality of games of chance is determined by a literal throw of the dice. That’s why it’s best to keep your calm and avoid tempting fate. Instead, it’s advisable to go with reliable and trustworthy gambling websites such as <a href=#>Arabic-Casinos.org</a>. When visiting someone in the Middle East, don’t cry over spilled coffee; it’s a cause for celebration and joy.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Attracting_The_Evil_Eye></span>Attracting The Evil Eye<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Do you find yourself unexpectedly ill? Have you had an unexpected setback, such as damage in your new car? Maybe you were let go from your job? These incidents are frequently attributed in the Arab world to the mysterious phenomenon known as the evil eye.</p><p>The evil eye is a curse of mythical proportions that has been passed down from one generation to the next for centuries, striking fear into the hearts of those who have believed in its power since ancient times. It’s said that the evil eye has the strength to break valuables around the house, drain a person’s vitality, or even cause their demise with just a glance that’s meant to cause harm, misery, or any other kind of misfortune.</p><p>In ancient Greece and Rome, the evil eye was thought to be the root of all evil, and any bad luck that came your way was blamed on the evil eye. There are a plethora of ways to protect oneself from the evil eye, but the most popular method is to use the <a href=#>Evil Eye</a> or Hamsa amulet, which is thought to repel malevolence and harmful vibes.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Seeing_Shoes_Lying_Upside_Down></span>Seeing Shoes Lying Upside Down<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ever had your world turned upside down by finding your shoe in an unexpected position? Well, it seems like the stars aren’t aligned in your favor, pal! If you come across an upside-down shoe, brace yourself for some serious hootin’ and hollerin’ from the Arab folks until you set it straight! It’s said to be a jinx that invites trouble and a string of mishaps.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/clichemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/amazed-woman-standing-under-umbrella-during-leak-in-kitchen-stockpack-deposit-photos-310x375.jpg alt="middle eastern culture" width=310 height=375 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a>This old wives’ tale goes way back to the days when folks dwelled in abodes with earthen floors. Back in the day, creepy crawlies like lethal spiders and scorpions would sneak into people’s shoes, giving them a rude awakening and causing countless casualties before anyone acted. This eventually became a jinxed superstition that brought misfortune.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Opening_An_Umbrella_Indoors></span>Opening An Umbrella Indoors<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Make sure to hold your horses and not pop open your umbrella until you step out of your abode, or else you’ll invite trouble and misfortune! Back in the days of ancient Egypt, folks used an umbrella to shield themselves from the blazing sun. But beware; if you dared to pop open that umbrella indoors, you were asking for trouble with the sun god. The superstition around opening umbrellas indoors is thought to have originated from the belief that doing so would infuriate the sun god Ra, resulting in his fury raining down on you like a storm of bad luck.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Leaving_Scissors_Open></span>Leaving Scissors Open<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/clichemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/open-scissors-stockpack-deposit-photos-500x333.jpg alt="middle eastern culture" width=351 height=234 sizes="(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a>Word on the street is that in Egypt, if you keep playing with scissors without actually using them or if you leave them open, you’re asking for trouble. They say it’s like turning a frown upside down, but in reverse—you’ll go from happy-go-lucky to down in the dumps in no time. The myth is cutting-edge, as it revolves around the sharp function of scissors, which cuts not only things but also creates a rift between people, tearing up relationships.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Having_Itchy_Palms></span>Having Itchy Palms<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>If you have an itchy palm, refrain from giving it a rub! If your left hand is itching, it’s a sign that you might be in for a financial windfall. However, be careful not to count your chickens before they hatch, as scratching that itch could make the money fly away like birds. If your right palm is itching, it’s a bad omen for your financial situation. Your funds might be going down the drain soon. What if you have an itchy palm on both sides? Well, then you’re in for a stroke of good luck and a bountiful day ahead.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Final_Thoughts></span>Final Thoughts<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Throughout history, <a href=#>luck has held immense cultural significance</a>, and this is especially prominent in Middle Eastern culture. While some of these beliefs may seem peculiar, they are deeply rooted in the fabric of society, and people continue to hold them dear. So just make sure to keep your shoes the right way up, don’t play with scissors, and always spill your coffee, and you should be fine!</p><p>Read more <a href=#>lifestyle articles</a> at <a href=#>ClichéMag.com</a><br>Images provided by <a href=#>BingAI</a>, <a href=#>Adobe Stock</a>, <a href=#>Flickr</a>, <a href=#>Unsplash</a>, <a href=#>Pexels</a>, <a href=#>Pixabay</a> & <a href=#>Creative Commons</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnJ6wqbHMmp5nm5%2BifK21xZ6qrbGcmny0wc%2Beqaysmam2sLqMmqWdZZyqsKx5yKdkpqGUmbmmecSaqq2doqN6pMHLrayrnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
