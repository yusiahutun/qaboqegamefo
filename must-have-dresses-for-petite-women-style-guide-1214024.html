Mini skirts</strong></p><p>In terms of clothes for the shorter woman, mini skirts that end 3-4 inches above the knee are one of the most flattering items.

Not only are they an essential component in terms of fashion for short women, but they're super comfortable, fashionable and add a few extra inches effortlessly. Platform sneakers are great for casual events and days out in the sun which involve a ton of walking around, while for more formal and dressy events you can opt for stylish platform heels.&nbsp; However, when choosing your shoes, make sure they're not too bulky as that will hamper the proportion as well as draw the eye down instead of upwards.</p><p><img alt="Tara Sutaria (Credits: Instagram)" title="Tara Sutaria (Credits: Instagram)" width=1170 height=1207 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-03/1679751970_d9621efe-c5fb-46e9-a3ef-9f9810782223.jpeg></p><p><strong>8.&nbsp;Jumpsuits</strong></p><p>Jumpsuits are super versatile. Not only do they have an elongating effect on the body but they can also be styled in a ton of different ways. From red carpet level dressy to business casual for petite woman- there is no end to the ways you can style a simple jumpsuit. Keep it classy with a black jumper and golden jewelry or take a more playful approach with prints, patterns and colors. You can also experiment with your hair by going for a fun pony for a day out or put it up in a sleek bun for formal occasions. All in all- a jumpsuit is the way to go, for whenever you're confused about what to wear!</p><p><img alt="Aditi Rao Hydari (Credits: Instagram)" title="Aditi Rao Hydari (Credits: Instagram)" width=1170 height=1176 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-03/1679755053_e410710d-07f9-459d-a029-674c06efc93a.jpeg></p><p><strong>9.&nbsp;Cowboy Boots</strong></p><p>In terms of outfit ideas for petite ladies, boots are a great footwear that leads itself to an elongating look. They're classy, trendy and add a few extra inches if they have a heel. However, finding the right fit can be a challenge. Always opt for over the knee boots or ankle length boots, and stay away from mid-calf boots. Mid-length boots cut off the legs at an awkward point and will make one look shorter than they are, whereas boots that extend over the knee will create a single vertical line and add proportion. Pairing boots with denims or stockings in the same color will help create length and make you look taller.</p><p><img alt="Tara Sutaria (Credits: Instagram) " title="Tara Sutaria (Credits: Instagram) " width=1170 height=1217 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-03/1679749318_fe2c0e48-28ae-405a-8e95-ea60b435237b.jpeg></p><p><strong>10.&nbsp;Corsets and fitted tees</strong></p><p>Not only are corsets super trendy in terms of fashion, but they look great, flatter your curves and provide your outfit with structure and flair. Moreover corsets are usually detailed which draws the attention of the eye upwards focusing on your better features such as your collarbones, shoulders and face. Pair your corset top with an elongating maxi skirt or flattering bootcut denims for a cute outfit for petite frames. Accessorize with layered necklaces, hoop earrings and even a few stacked bracelets- to elevate the look.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p><img alt="Ananya Panday (Credits: Instagram)" title="Ananya Panday (Credits: Instagram)" width=1170 height=1133 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-03/1679749656_276e4f35-02c3-4307-9901-0e8080a6a738.jpeg></p><p><strong>11.&nbsp;Elongating Skirts</strong></p><p>Skirts are often risky territory when it comes to short women dresses- however maxi skirts that run along the length of your legs and elongate your frame, are a great addition to your wardrobe. Skirts that are cinched at the waist and hug your hips and thighs while continuing till your ankles will give the illusion of longer legs, and make you feel more confident if not instantly taller.</p><p><img alt="Shilpa Shetty (Credits: Instagram)" title="Shilpa Shetty (Credits: Instagram)" width=1170 height=1220 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-03/1679752526_4bf43d40-d773-4701-a8e2-ecc950d3a948.jpeg></p><p><strong>12. Cropped fits</strong></p><p>Cropped t-shirts, shorts and outerwear is a great way to add breaks to your outfit and prevent them from looking bulky. Cropped t-shirts highlight your midriff and draw the eye upwards. They add proportion to your body and make it look more defined overall. Opt for well fitted crop tops that hug your upper body instead of baggy cropped tees as that will add extra definition to the outfit as well as make you look more fit overall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Alaya F (Credits: Instagram)" title="Alaya F (Credits: Instagram)" width=1170 height=918 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-03/1679755192_a3e2f202-89bb-436f-9704-802c6754a9f8.jpeg></p><p><strong>13. V Neck Ensembles</strong></p><p>The V-neck silhouette is great for short girls because it lengthens the neck area and draws the eye upwards. It's a classic design that can be styled according to your fashion and vibe- from classic shirts for formal occasions to casual tees for more relaxed days. Paired with a delicate necklace, a v-neck outfit is one of the most flattering dresses for short ladies, and since it can be elevated according to the occasion, it's extremely versatile.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Alia Bhatt (Credits: Instagram)" title="Alia Bhatt (Credits: Instagram)" width=1170 height=1077 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-03/1679754406_710b4253-142d-438a-899b-ee80cf09ca1d.jpeg></p><p><strong>14. High rise silhouettes</strong></p><p>As mentioned before, high rise silhouettes are great for short girls because they give the illusion that everything beyond the cinched waist is legs. It gives the illusion of longer legs, and draws the eyes from up to down, along the length of the bottoms. Turtleneck outfits and other high necklines can shorten the top half, and make you look even smaller than imagined. From high waisted tailored trousers to high waisted mini-skirts- any bottoms that can be converted into a high rise outfit is great in terms of dresses for petite curvy ladies.</p><p><img alt="Alaya F (Credits: Instagram)" title="Alaya F (Credits: Instagram)" width=1170 height=958 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-03/1679755127_34418c7a-e460-4651-84ae-7b517213b634.jpeg></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p><strong>15.
