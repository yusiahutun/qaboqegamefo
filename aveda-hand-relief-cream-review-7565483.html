I grabbed her hand to cross the street and once we were on the other side, she just kept running her fingers over the palms of my hand. “Oh my god, your hands are so soft. Have they always been like this?” I didn’t have an answer to that question but in the years following I received iterations of that compliment frequently. The answer back then was, and to this day continues to be, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Aveda’s Hand Relief Cream</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The discovery of the hand cream was happenstance. Growing up I used <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Aveda hair products</a> religiously on my curls; it was one of the few brands to understand the needs for diverse hair types off the bat. During one of my restock shopping trips, the salespeople gave me a few tiny sample tubes of the hand cream. After finishing those, I went back and bought the full-size <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Hand Relief</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The cream felt really thick when I first applied it, then it thinned out like light cream, before completely dissolving and becoming one with my skin. I can apply it several times a day <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>without any pilling</a>, and my hands never feel greasy or oily. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Aveda’s Hand Relief</a> makes my skin so soft that despite trying dozens of other options, I always come back to it.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The naturally-derived formula features the little-known andiroba oil as the star ingredient. The oil is harvested from tree nuts and has <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>a number of benefits</a> — it’s particularly high in fatty acids, which help heal skin, promote collagen production, and reduce inflammation.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Don’t just take it from me — the hand cream has the approval of thousands of five-star reviewers who think it’s amazing as well. Many shoppers concur that it’s “the best hand lotion” and rave that it “takes away” wrinkles and “cures dry hands.” A handful of beaming reviews also come from nurses, some with hands “dry to the point of being cracked and bleeding.” “My fingertips had started to split and my cuticles were AWFUL! Not anymore!” one nurse wrote. Another commented that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Aveda’s Hand Relief</a> is the “best product” they’ve bought for their hands, “ever.” “I even had to see a doctor, [and] the doctor was impressed with how this healed my hands.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Head to Nordstrom and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Aveda’s Hand Relief Cream</a> to your cart for just $11; I swear my hands look the same now as they did a decade ago because of it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wK%2BcnZldna6vsIyrnKWhlZt6pL7EmqRmqpWrtqbDjHBsb21kbYA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
