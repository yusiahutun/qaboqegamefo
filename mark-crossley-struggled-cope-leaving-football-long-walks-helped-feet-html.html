I had done more than 30 non-stop years of playing and coaching. I thought I was ready for a break. But when it came and all my life’s structure was taken away I hadn’t a clue how to handle it.’</p><br><p class=mol-para-with-font>Crossley had been coaching at Chesterfield when his old Forest team-mate John Sheridan was sacked. It terminated – for now at least – a career that started as a 17-year-old goalkeeper for Forest in 1987.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>That same month, Crossley’s father Geoff was diagnosed with cancer. Crossley attended oncology appointments with him and thought he would lose him.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Everything felt as though it was closing in at once,’ Crossley recalled.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘There are triggers that can make people mentally unstable and it can be different for different people. These things turned out to be mine.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I was life and soul of the dressing room as a player. One of the daft lads. But behind it I was always a deep thinker, you know. I could struggle to sleep sometimes.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘So maybe something was always there. Who knows?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Whatever the case, when it came and when it hit me, it hit me hard.’&nbsp;</p><img id=i-4a70e828c8a65f1c src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/03/20/53746381-0-image-a-36_1643919179126.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="Crossley, pictured at the Peak District's Langsett Reservoir, has grown to love the outdoors" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Crossley, pictured at the Peak District's Langsett Reservoir, has grown to love the outdoors</p>&nbsp;<p class=mol-para-with-font>It's just after 10am on a Monday morning and we are standing on a path above Langsett Reservoir on the edge of the Peak District. We are looking across the hills to the east. Crossley’s dog Roxy is at his feet.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Sometimes I come here at 6am to watch the sun rise over there,’ points Crossley.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It’s beautiful.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Two years after what he know describes as a mental health crisis, Crossley’s mornings are much improved. Getting out of bed is no longer a problem.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Crossley’s recovery was helped by the PFA and the ten sessions at the Sporting Chance clinic they paid for. But largely his road back to happiness began the moment he started to put one foot in front of the other.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Crossley, 52, says walking has changed his life. ‘My friend Dave knew I was struggling and asked me to come for a walk one day,’ he recalled. ‘I was like: “Why?”.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I was one of them who thought: “The car is on the drive so let’s use it”.&nbsp;‘But we did it – about six miles near my home in Barnsley - and that was how it started. I got back in the house and I just felt better. That first walk for me was like an addiction. An absolute game changer.'</p><img id=i-d0610f809b110f99 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/03/19/53745065-0-image-m-35_1643918278584.jpg height=544 width=634 alt="Crossley celebrating during a 1991 FA Cup semi-final win over West Ham" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Crossley celebrating during a 1991 FA Cup semi-final win over West Ham</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It has given me a structure back. Everything in football is about constant routine. You are told what time to turn up, what to eat, when to eat, what time the coach leaves.

As long as my diary reflects that structure then I am ok.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Crossley walks every day of his life, about 50 miles a week. But what started as an aid to his own recovery has now grown in to something much bigger.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>On his hat the wording says #walking’sbrilliant, a phrase coined by Crossley on Twitter. On his coat is a logo that says WATCH. It stands for Walking and Talking Charity Hikes.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Over the last 18 months or so, Crossley has teamed up with other former footballers such as Chris Kirkland, Dean Windass, Steve Howey and Nigel Jemson. All have struggled since leaving the game and all have now embraced the benefits of walking.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>WATCH does not yet have official charity status but that has not stopped the group raising £80,000 through merchandise sales, golf days and a coast to coast walk last year that Crossley describes as the hardest thing he has ever done. Next is the Three Peak Challenge – Ben Nevis, Snowdon and Scafell – while a hike up Kilimanjaro is also planned.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Money has so far been distributed to charities and groups in towns close to their hearts.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘There is a charity in Nottingham for bereaved parents and we kitted their new office out,’ explained Crossley.</p><img id=i-8cbf12b860848f1f src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/03/20/53746373-0-image-a-38_1643919188118.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="Crossley and Sportsmail's Ian Ladyman enjoy a walk in the Peak District" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Crossley and Sportsmail's Ian Ladyman enjoy a walk in the Peak District</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘In Hull we have a van for people with brain tumours. We have bought a storage container for a mental health fishing group in Doncaster. We do what we can.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Crossley’s Twitter following numbers 40,000 and he has received hundreds of direct messages from people suffering with their mental health.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I try and point them to their GP or another professional,’ he explained.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I am not an expert. But I also tell them what has worked for me. Walk, talk, structure.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Recently Crossley received a ‘Points of Light’ certificate from the Prime Minister. It is awarded for people making a difference in their community. WATCH have had video messages from Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp. The Liverpool manager, it turns out, did a dissertation on walking as part of his coaching badges.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Meanwhile Crossley’s own journey goes on.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I am much better now,’ he said. ‘But I still have moments. I would not say I was totally stable. Like, if I sat down at home now and hadn’t planned next week I would start to over-think everything and would be up all night. It is silly but I can’t help it. So I would get up the next morning and get that diary in place. And then go for a walk.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>If walking has set the course for the second half of Crossley’s life then a man called Brian Clough was largely responsible for the first.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Crossley’s Clough stories form the foundations of his after-dinner routine. He is fortunate to be able to do a more than passable impersonation of the late Forest manager.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I have a canvas of Cloughie on the wall at home,’ he revealed.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘My wife said I never stop talking about him so she bought me it.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘And she is right. I do love talking about him. I owe him everything.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Crossley played for Clough for six years. Clough gave him his first contract and had four nicknames for his young goalkeeper.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘He called me ‘Barnsley’, ‘Imbecile’ and ‘Sh*thouse’,’ smiled Crossley.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Then when I got in the team it was ‘Jigsaw’.</p><img id=i-695509d6ef824ea5 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/03/20/53746367-0-image-a-40_1643919202053.jpg height=418 width=634 alt="Crossley is an ambassador for WATCH.

It was because I had shaken hands with the referee.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>None of it remotely phased Crossley. It had all started like it was to continue, after all.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘The first contract I ever signed with him was blank,’ he said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Just a blue piece of paper with blank spaces where all the wages and bonus and years should have been.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Obviously I said I couldn’t sign it.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘He said: “Either sign it or piss off and play for Barnsley”.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘He said I had five minutes to think so I signed it. It was £500 a quid a week in the end and he gave me his daughter’s car as well.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘You couldn’t just get a car at Forest. You had to ask him.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘”Can I have a car boss?”</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘”No because I think you’re and idiot”.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Anyway when I signed the contract there were some keys in the envelope. It was nice. A white XR3i with a soft top.

I just looked up to him and loved him.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I think he would love it if he knew what I was doing now. He would not have expected this.’&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;<p class=mol-para-with-font>Crossley played for Middlesbrough, Fulham and Oldham and also eight times for Wales. But Forest has always been his club. He played more than 300 league games across thirteen years and also in the FA Cup Final that was lost to Tottenham in 1991. Crossley saved a penalty that day, one of only three goalkeepers to ever do so in the final.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘At half-time I thought the headlines were mine,’ he smiled ruefully.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This weekend Forest face Leicester in round four at the City Ground. The last time Forest played a Premier League game was on the last day of their relegation season in 1999 and Leicester were the opposition. Crossley was in the team.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I can’t believe the club have never been back up,’ he said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘But the reason is simple. Just too many managers’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Crossley was at the City Ground when Forest beat Barnsley last week. He believes they have a chance of progress under the club’s 23rd manager since that day in May 1999, Welshman Steve Cooper.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It’s sad but when you look at the crowd before the Derby game recently you can see how big the club is and it looks like they have a chance now,’ Crossley said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I like the look of Steve Cooper. Going up in front of the crowd and giving it everything. They want that. They love it.’</p><img id=i-64e2b378d8709ab5 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/03/21/53748939-0-image-a-43_1643922898760.jpg height=406 width=634 alt="Crossley is pleased at the progress Forest have been making under manager Steve Cooper" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Crossley is pleased at the progress Forest have been making under manager Steve Cooper</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Crossley was offered a job at the Forest academy after leaving Chesterfield two years ago.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I was really tempted,’ he said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘But I wanted to stay out of the game and see how I went.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I didn’t expect what has happened and I have suffered.
