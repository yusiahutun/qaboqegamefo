Recent Korean shows such as Sweet Home, The Uncanny Counter and The School Nurse Files have mined genre tropes popularised overseas and given them an emotional twist."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It became the most successful Korean film, a title it held for eight years.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/02/15/06d4e871-ca03-4896-aba0-972274adba37_5b21820d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fast-forward a decade and the torch was passed to Yeon Sang-ho, who took a chance on a genre considered to be cheap, tacky and generally anathema to Korean audiences: zombie films. <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Train to Busan</span></a> was the most successful Korean film of 2016 and the first to make significant inroads in multiplexes around the world.</p>Yeon’s film had a catchy concept – zombies on a train – as well as all the trimmings of a polished Korean blockbuster: an attractive cast, strong production values, and an appealing mix of humour, tension and pathos. But what set it apart was its social commentary. The film acted as a takedown of government responses to national emergencies, just two years after&nbsp;<a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">the sinking of the Sewol Ferry</span></a>&nbsp;in South Korea in which 250 schoolchildren drowned.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Inside the K-drama streaming wars: can anyone match Netflix?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Train to Busan’s success opened the doors to a new kind of storytelling in Korea. Studios and networks understood that Korean audiences were keen for different kinds of thrills, often with fantasy and horror components. What’s more, with world-class visual effects finally available domestically and the rising global interest in Korean content, it was possible to bring more ambitious stories to the screen.</p>By the time <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Netflix</span></a> embarked on its first Korean original series, the genre was in full swing. The first property the streaming giant greenlit was a period zombie horror-thriller: <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Kingdom</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kingdom also included allegorical tangents about politics and society, but, as with all trends in Korea, this one was evolving quickly and a new subgenre emerged in its wake – one that is emblematic of a stark evolution in the styles and concerns of writers of Korean popular fiction.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/02/15/15079b2f-39a2-4286-a837-9e83e3870a14_11bfa470.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the Western canon of sci-fi, the raison d’être for these stories, beyond aesthetics, has been lofty ideas touching on politics, sociology and even theology and metaphysics. In South Korea, some of these ideas, which tend to sprout from individualistic mindsets, have found less favour. For Korean creators, the drive of any story, whether family drama or action thriller, is invariably rooted in emotional concerns.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Thus shows like Sweet Home, The Uncanny Counter and The School Nurse Files feel like a natural and essentially Korean variant of the high-concept genre content that viewers have come to embrace in the past few years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The protagonists, stuck in a high-rise, must face off against monsters in Sweet Home, but they know that at any moment they could turn into monsters themselves. One of the side characters in the show, who does turn into a monster, becomes a gigantic but harmless embryo, symbolic of the trauma she experienced as a mother losing her child.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/02/15/42b9907b-e7c9-4480-bfc3-f4475023ba0a_595de0ff.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In The School Nurse Files, the titular nurse guards a school from “jellies”, which are expressions of the students’ emotions. Most are innocuous, but if left unchecked, they can grow into something far more dangerous. Beyond emotions such as love, fear and loneliness, the show also delves into the destructive powers of peer pressure and bigotry.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Uncanny Counter features a group of noodle house restaurateurs who battle demons that prey on weak souls and compel them to kill. Not just anyone is in danger of being possessed by these demons; only people with a predisposition to violence (falling anywhere on a spectrum from sociopathy to domestic neglect) can be targeted.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tellingly, all three shows originated from either books or webtoons, and plenty more stories exist out there, waiting to be adapted.
