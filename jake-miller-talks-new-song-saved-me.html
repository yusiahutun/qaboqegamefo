I'm just really happy these days so I want my music to reflect that.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Miller says he wrote “Saved Me” in September about his relationship with his girlfriend, whom he says came into his life at the perfect time.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Jake Miller.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Joshua Valle</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I went through a really tough breakup a few years ago, and I never thought that I would get out of that slump,” he says. “I felt like I was just drifting farther and farther away from who I am. When I met her, it really just brought me back to who I am and made me feel like me again.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“In a sense, she really saved me,” he adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The upbeat earworm contrasts from some of her past tracks but still has “that Jake Miller-ness that my fans love in my music.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Jake Miller.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Joshua Valle</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I was down, I was down, now I’m all the way up,” he sings on the track. “Almost drowned, pulled me out, right before I gave up. You saved me.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Miller says his girlfriend loved the song as soon as he made it and that “she knows every word.” He also revealed that the two will soon be moving in together later this year.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: R&B Duo Chloe x Halle Talk About Their 'Drama Love Story' Song 'Catch Up' Featuring Swae Lee</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“She's my best friend,” he says. “We're really excited! We're gonna get a house together and just concentrate on being happy and forgetting the past and just moving on.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for now, the “LAST TEXT” singer is bonding at home with his parents and siblings in Florida — and the Millers are documenting their time at home with goofy videos on TikTok, including a series called “Quarantunes.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I think when all this is done, we're gonna be really happy that we have these videos to look back on,” he says. “As weird as the time was, I think it's also been a really good time and a really healthy time for us.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for future releases, Miller says he has “two albums worth of music ready to go,” but is unsure if “Saved Me” will be part of a larger project. However, he adds that he’s excited for the track to be the introduction to a new era of music.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And although getting off the road has been hard, he’s used the time to connect with his fans on FaceTime.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I'm rolling with the punches and everybody's in the same boat here,” he says. “I FaceTime a lot of fans and do it every week. If you don't have your fans, then you don't have anything. They’re the reason that I'm here and that I'm able to do this so I'll FaceTime them, I'll check in on them, play the music over the phone.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“That’s what it’s all about,” he adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Saved Me” is out May 15.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ52qwKqvjqOYpJ1doratuMSrZK2ZnKDAbrrEsGSsp56cerSt1Z6bZqWVZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
