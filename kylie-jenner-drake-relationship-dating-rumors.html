The source added, "Kylie was rapping to songs and dancing with her friends while she was next to Drake, but they weren't dancing together, they seemed to have a connection though."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A different source for the outlet also said, "They seemed to be enjoying each other's company. They were joking around and Kylie was laughing. She seemed to be really happy and in a great mood and her and Drake seemed very comfortable with each other. There seemed to be an attraction there."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Another source for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://pagesix.com/2019/10/24/inside-drakes-vip-mobster-themed-birthday-bash/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Page Six" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Page Six</a> said that they saw Drake chatting with both Jenner and Corey Gamble "for a while," although it may have been more of Drake's star hosting abilities rather than his romantic connection with the Kylie Cosmetics founder.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"He was actually the quintessential gentleman," the source told the outlet. "He greeted people and said hello to everyone and shook hands. He really had a good time with his friends and was laughing â€¦ He literally worked the room for the entire party."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The dating rumors come less than a month after Jenner <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a29335726/kylie-jenner-travis-scott-break-up-2019/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="split from baby daddy Travis Scott" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">split from baby daddy Travis Scott</a>, although <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a29342914/kylie-jenner-travis-scott-stormi-custody/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the two are reportedly on good terms" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">the two are reportedly on good terms</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What happened after the party?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/tv/kylie-jenner-drake-spending-romantic-time-together/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">People</a>, an inside source revealed that the two have been hanging out "romantically" since she split from Scott.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"He and Kylie have been spending time together recently," the insider said.

And a third source also continued to deny the dating rumors.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Since when have they seen each other romantically?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A source at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/drake-has-always-had-a-thing-for-kylie-jenner-its-mutual/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Us class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Us</a> revealed that Drake has apparently "always had a thing" for Jenner, although their relationship "isn't anything serious."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Drake has always had a thing for Kylie and it's mutual," the source said. "They hang out here and there and have been more recently than in the past because Kylie is technically single right now and the two of them live so close to each other."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Still, their relationship is murky.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"They have known each other and been friends for a very long time and there has always been a spark there, but their situation is complicated and so is Kylie's with Travis," the source said, referring to Jenner's recent breakup with Travis Scott.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Drake and Kylie don't want to jeopardize their friendship by crossing any major boundaries. Drake doesn't have any intention of taking on a fatherly role with Stormi and he wants to have fun with Kylie with no strings attached and continue to have a friendship and be supportive of one another."</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=27 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Are they dropping hints about their supposed fling?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A new Instagram photo of Drake has fans speculating once again. The rapper uploaded a selfie of himself in a sweatshirt from Sierra Canyon, the school that Jenner attended as a child, and a baseball cap with a lip imprint on the front, possibly a nod toward Jenner's famous lip kits.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He captioned the suggestive photo simply with, "ðŸ’‹."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Jenner, too, possibly dropped hints on her own Instagram by posting a photo of seemingly innocuous vending machines at the Kylie Cosmetics HQ.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On one side is a bubblegum-pink Skittles vending machine, and on the other is a champagne vending machine.

A lot more obvious, actually.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
