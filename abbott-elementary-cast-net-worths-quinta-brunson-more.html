The beloved ABC series, created by<strong> Quinta Brunson</strong>, premiered in December 2021 and its viewership has been on a steady rise ever since.</p><p>In fact, Abbott Elementary snagged a whopping seven nominations at the 2022 Emmy Awards. By the end of the night, Abbott Elementary went home with three big wins: Outstanding Cast for a Comedy Series, <strong>Sheryl Lee Ralph</strong> as Barbara Howard for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series and “Pilot” for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series.</p><p>While Abbott Elementary is hardly the only successful comedy series in the last decade, Quinta was determined to make sure the series landed on network television vs. a streaming platform like Netflix or Hulu.</p><p>“I was very interested in it being on network TV, specifically ABC, because I just think that ABC represents family viewing. I think that streaming and everything is fine, but I do think streaming Netflix or Hulu, or even HBO Max is not necessarily geared toward the family viewer. I think they have been trying to crack that for a while,” the Philadelphia native explained in a June 2022 interview with <a href=#>Deadline</a>.</p><p>“What do shows look like for people who are both 55 and 25 to watch together at the same time? And I just don’t think that streaming has really captured that yet. And I think people still look to network for those kinds of shows. And I knew that Abbott was a show like that. I knew that it was meant to be seen by many different people. And I wanted that for it,” Quinta continued.</p><p>The She Memes Well: Essays author went on to express her gratitude over Abbott Elementary truly being a family show.</p><p>“One of my favorite things to hear is when people say, ‘My gosh, this is what I watch with my family, it’s the only thing I can watch with my children.’ And younger people being like, ‘I’ve been watching it with my grandma, we both love it.’ That’s what I still feel you can get from network, you know? I think that’s still unique to that space,” Quinta said.</p><p>Catch new episodes of Abbott Elementary on ABC on Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to see the cast of Abbott Elementary‘s net worths.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46amZunpKl6prjEppynrJGnxm6vwKyrZqaVqXq4u9Gtn6xloaq2r8DAZpmrrZ6ovK95zKipnmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
