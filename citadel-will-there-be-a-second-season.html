We're not officially greenlit for a second season. However, what I can say is that, you know, the Citadel universe is robust, and there are so many threads by the end of the season that would be very thrilling to pick up in a second season and hopefully beyond.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Amazon’s new spy thriller Citadel starring Richard Madden and Priyanka Chopra Jonas</figure><p id=etm3rXk5JGv data-wc=49>"So there's a lot of mythology to unpack. You know, myself and the other members of the creative team – we've been living with this series for so many years now. So, you know, sort of strap in, I would say, because there's certainly a ride to come, hopefully."&nbsp;</p><p id=edBf6rjEImV data-wc=62>The hit new show follows two spies who once worked for Citadel, an ultra-exclusive spy agency, before the network was discovered by the group Manticore, who killed almost off the agents, while others had their memories wiped as part of the protocol. In it, Richard plays Mason Kane, a man unable to recall his past memories, while Priyanka plays Nadia, his once-partner.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2bf43354ded0-cidls1ut220516abepau00027r43000.jpg><p id=eU-8cOAn8gN data-wc=78>Speaking about the episode he was most excited for fans to watch, executive producer Joe Russo said: "I think that sixth episode. And what's great about the show is that it was designed like an onion, you're peeling back the layers of it. We use these twisting shots throughout the show to represent when the narrative is upside down, and that you can't trust anything that you see, and I think it goes to a really powerful climax."&nbsp;</p><p id=ePU5OixOUl data-wc=13><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Priyanka Chopra shares she spent 10 days in hospital after work crisis</a></strong></p><p id=eu1-3RDZysU data-wc=14><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Priyanka Chopra's show Citadel to bring her closer to home with huge incentive</a></p><p id=efuCcIAHRVJB data-wc=89>Stanley Tucci, who also stars in the show as Bernard Orlick, added: "That's hard to say because what I saw was a rough cut of six episodes. So I haven't seen, really, the final version of it. I like them all, and I'm not saying that because I'm a part of it. I like them all. I think they're amazing. And it's so surprising, in one episode you think this is gonna happen, the next thing that happens, that happens. It's so complex that I'd say all of them."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4f8c650c0d97-cidls1ut210810prijon00491r43000.jpg><p id=ePhQGArRlVBl data-wc=72>Fans have been quick to discuss the series online, with one person tweeting: "I've been craving for a good spy series and came across #Citadel. I watched the first 3 episodes straight," another person added: "Can we just take a moment to talk about how Priyanka Chopra is just shining through every single episode of Citadel every week? She just keeps getting better and better. Blowing my mind as more secrets untangle."</p><p id=edkGWJPhKEko data-wc=40>A third person posted: "Citadel is honestly getting better and better. @priyankachopra and @_richardmadden kick a whole lot of ass literally and performance-wise. Very curious to see how season 1 wraps itself up in 2 episodes *please stick the landing.’"&nbsp;</p><h2>More snaps from the sexy spy drama Citadel...</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9e28d42d30f7-citadel-richard-priyanka.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/42dce67c1ed9-citadel-episode-one-nadia-mason.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/021cc35b0b31-stanley-tucci-as-bernard-orlick-citadel.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/b93960bdd801-priyanka-chopra-as-nadia-citadel.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6d4d64a2e646-mason-nadia-shooting-and-fighting-citadel.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/4ce2ab4ba0b0-richard-madden-as-mason-kane-citadel.jpg><p id=ew4kEq-NWpU data-wc=22></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
