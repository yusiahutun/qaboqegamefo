Finally, she decided it was the perfect place to start her next chapter.</p><p>“​​I discovered almost immediately that Nashville was even more fun and exciting than I could have dreamed,” she told <a href=#>Nashville Lifestyles</a> in December 2020 of moving. “I had a beautiful group of friends, a loving community of fellow believers, and an extraordinary pool of insanely talented writers to work with. I could not wait to get settled in and begin a brand-new life.”</p><p>Prior to making the big <a href=#>move to Nashville</a>, Kathie Lee lived in the Connecticut home she once shared with her husband, Frank Gifford, and kids Cassidy and Cody Gifford. After Frank’s sudden death at 84 in August 2015, she decided it was time to move on from the home.</p><p>“This home of mine in Connecticut, where Frank and I raised our beautiful children and we had so many happy years, when I was living there alone dogs can only do so much for you, and I love my dogs,” she said during a January 2020 appearance on Today. “But it went from being the most teeming, thrilling, joyful — all the dog sounds, the kid sounds, the smoke in the grill and, you know, it just was life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Where-Does-Kathie-Lee-Gifford-Live-Photos-of-Nashville-Home.jpg><h2>Does Kathie Lee Gifford Still Live in Nashville?</h2><p>Kathie Lee still lives in Nashville in a <a href=#>7,965-square-foot brownstone</a> in a gated community.
