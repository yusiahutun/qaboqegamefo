Thanks to one simple like on her timeline, Carrie Underwood set off quite the Twitter controversy this week.
On Tuesday, the &#34;American Idol&#34; alum threw a &#34;like&#34; at a post from conservative commentator Matt Walsh, who shared video from a recent Metro Nashville Public Schools board meeting showing him giving a speech slamming mask mandates for children.
Earlier this month, the school board adopted a mask policy applying to all students, staff and visitors for the new school year."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

While Governor Bill Lee issued an executive order this week giving a student's parent or guardian the right to opt out of such mandates, Metro Nashville Public Schools is, so far, refusing to comply.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Here is my speech to the Nashville School Board where I spoke out against the cruel and indefensible mask mandate for children <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Eq5IFsKyja</a></p>‚Äî Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) <a href=#>August 12, 2021</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@MattWalshBlog</a><p>In Walsh's video, he compares putting masks on children to "muzzles" on "rabid dogs" -- and said the mandate ignores "evidence, science, common sense and decency." He claimed Covid posed no threat to children, said masks were equivalent to "child abuse" and the mandates would lead to "psychological damage." He also argued the ruling was a political move and not one made in the name of safety.</p><p>While Underwood didn't comment on the post or retweet it, her "Like" still helped get the video on the timelines of her 8.2 million fans -- many of whom were surprised to see her presumed support. &nbsp;As screen grabs of her "Likes" tab started to go viral on Twitter, many started weaponizing her own songs against her.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Maybe next time she‚Äôll think before she tweets <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/zzRgzrXi8Z</a></p>‚Äî Lauren Hough (@laurenthehough) <a href=#>August 17, 2021</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@laurenthehough</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jesus, take the wheel. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/wLhZde87aR</a></p>‚Äî Charlotte Clymer üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà (@cmclymer) <a href=#>August 17, 2021</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@cmclymer</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>Surprised by how many of you are surprised by the fact that the woman who has a hit single called ‚ÄúJesus Take The Wheel‚Äù may not be so into masks and vaccines.</p>‚Äî James Fulton (@James_Fulton22) <a href=#>August 17, 2021</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@James_Fulton22</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wait... so you're telling me that Carrie Underwood, a country music singer who had a hit song called, "Jesus Take the Wheel" is conservative!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!!</p>‚Äî Tim Young (@TimRunsHisMouth) <a href=#>August 17, 2021</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@TimRunsHisMouth</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>Carrie Underwood being a God-over-Science person is the least surprising thing I‚Äôve heard today.</p><p>Delta take the wheel‚Ä¶</p>‚Äî John Pavlovitz (@johnpavlovitz) <a href=#>August 17, 2021</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@johnpavlovitz</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>The gays on they way to dig their keys into the side of Carrie Underwood little souped up 4 wheel drive!

She should know better than to indirectly endorse the opinions of an extremist and scoundrel such as myself. Her lack of judgment is appalling. I demand that she renounce me and apologize."</p><p>"How long before Carrie Underwood officially renounces me? I give it 12 hours, tops," he added. "I could be wrong though. I'm basing this on our general experience with celebrities who face public backlash from the left. In fairness, she could be the outlier. Time will tell."</p><p>She has yet to un-like the post. TooFab has reached out to Underwood's rep for additional comment.</p><p>In liking Walsh's message, Underwood now appears aligned with fellow celebrity Tennesseans like <a href=#>Jay Cutler</a> and "Good Luck Charlie" alum Leigh-Allyn Baker, who have also been very vocal against their children wearing masks in school.</p><p>While Baker made a speech about it at a recent school board meeting in Franklin, Tennessee, Cutler showed his support on Twitter. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sharing a screen shot of an article</a> about the call for masks before the meeting, he wrote, "Not this parent. Really hope I'm not put in the corner by Twitter in my first 24 hrs."</p><p>He also shared video of some more anti-mask speeches from the meeting and some of the protests outside. "Let's be clear. No one wants to go to a school board meeting," he captioned a video of a protest, "So this speaks volumes."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:0f7cde6f-96e0-4ab2-a339-5b4c316c4ecd data-container-ref=toofab:article:b221466a-1582-406b-8052-9ebbcd4175c7 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/97/5by4/2021/08/12/974244ebb1ad4f95a9fbdc06380a4e6b_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Twitter/Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Good Luck Charlie Star Goes on Anti-Mask Rant at Tennessee School Board Meeting</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>After claiming he was going to run for the school board himself, he later claimed he was fired by Uber Eats because their "views aren't aligned" -- and added, "Guess they don't like future School board members.
