But, he was harshly abused and beaten throughout his training. Before Jason turned fourteen, his father would hit him with a belt at home and slapped him on the way from practice when he wouldn’t perform as per the expectation.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>To make the matter worse, his dad even suffered from alcoholism and created a hostile environment at home. But his mother, Dening,&nbsp;was always there to comfort Jason and his two sisters.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-199 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>After the death of his father from stomach cancer&nbsp;when&nbsp;Jason&nbsp;was only 12, his mother admitted Jason to the reputed Kooralbyn International High School by selling the house to secure a good future for her son.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>As his mother wanted, Jason continued his golf practice, finished his schooling there, and graduated from Hills International College in the states.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Marriage,&nbsp;Children</h2><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Jason married his girlfriend, Ellie Harvey in 2009.
