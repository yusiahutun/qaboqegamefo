Spotify Feature, How To Dress Based On Your Music Style</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-06-15</div><p>All of your friends are posting these all over their social media, and you’re here staring down at your phone wondering: <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/how-to-see-spotify-wrapped/>What is a daylist?</a> This Spotify feature is taking the trends by storm and it’s never been easier to share your unique music taste with your colleagues throughout the day.</p><p>If you’re a person who loves to listen to every genre of music or if you love to stick it with just a few of your favorite songs, there’s always a daylist right for you. Just search yours up on <a href=# rel=nofollow>spotify.com/daylist</a> or enter ‘daylist’ on your search bar. Each daylist is packed with songs that you<a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/music/1725441/spotify-psychic/> listen to normally</a> at that time of day along with a few new ones and updates with a new title and song every couple of hours. I always appreciate a good daylist that’s hyperspecific to the genre that I listen to at the time like “yearning power ballad saturday afternoon” or “beatboxing resonance wednesday evening,” but I’m also a sucker for clever simple ones like “fancy elegant friday afternoon.”</p><p>I challenged myself to dress the workweek based on my daylists and what surprised me the most was how much my <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/fashion/shopping-guides/1725912/what-to-wear-to-olivia-rodrigo-concert/>personal style</a> related to the music that I listen to. I’m a big fan of indie music and K-Pop and I had pieces that perfectly meshed together to create the vibe that my daylists were giving off. Don’t believe me? Take a look below.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>hopeless romantic lovesick monday afternoon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/daylist-1.jpg><p>As a self-proclaimed hopeless romantic, I did identify with this daylist the most! My constant rotation includes Mitski, Laufey, and Lamp, and I relate to their delicate yet hard-hitting songs on such a personal level. Every hopeless romantic goes through life endlessly looking for love, and why not look cute while doing it? I donned my flowiest Sandy Liang dress and wore my Harlot Hands necklace shaped like a piano to try to attract those who I want. I also wore my darkest Gentle Monster sunglasses to hide the tears from failing to find love!</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>clean girl standing on business monday late night</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/daylist-4.jpg><p>I was super excited to dress this daylist up since my friend also had a concert at night with her band <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3TiCUxDWDi4qSDLITpkziT?si=ETlL4wwMQUWSI8CykTYY8A">Father Koi</a> after I completed the workday. This mix had a lot of girl powerhouses from Lorde to Charli XCX since <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id="https://open.spotify.com/track/01TnMXIy7mJJQ7E8uy937N?si=efcbdf0a77d543fe">“Von Dutch”</a> is on repeat for me. To blend a business casual outfit with a night out on the town kind of outfit, I wore a <a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=t1ZX7*4ybQA&mid=43148&u1=SC--&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww2.hm.com%2Fen_us%2Fproductpage.0988242004.html" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">generic oversized blazer</a> with a Hyein Seo dress alongside <a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://go.skimresources.com?id=87443X1593552&xs=1&xcust=SC--&url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.bombas.com%2Fproducts%2Fwomens-marls-knee-high%3Fvariant%3Dblack%26size%3Dm" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">knee-high socks</a> and some earrings. Can’t forget to bring the tote bag to bring home the work laptop!</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>delulu clean girl early morning</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/4.jpg><p>As someone who slightly identifies as a delulu girl, you never know when you’ll see your crush (even if it’s in the early morning)! The queen herself, Olivia Rodrigo inspired this outfit as she was touring NYC around the same time and her songs were included in the bulk of this daylist. Alongside her were a range of artists like Lexie Liu and Jung Kook to keep that upbeat tempo. With that groove, I tried to make a statement to someone who doesn’t even know I exist (yet!) with an incredibly unique thrifted top and a modest Marni skirt paired with light blue Gentle Monster glasses.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.6765498652291><h2>yearning writer tuesday afternoon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2.jpg><p>When I first saw this daylist on a random Tuesday afternoon, I immediately thought “How did they know that I was a writer?” This playlist includes lots from the last daylist but with a sprinkle of Japanese Breakfast, Phoebe Bridgers, Clairo, and all your favorite indie songwriter gals from 2017. I usually put this outfit on if I want to get a good chunk of writing for the day. Trust me, an outfit can shoot your productivity up tenfold with a boost of intellectual confidence.

As someone who spends a good amount of time in Downtown Manhattan, this outfit was inspired by being very cozy while also being very chic at the same time.
