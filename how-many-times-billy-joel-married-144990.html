They then welcomed baby No. 2 together on October 22, 2017.</p><p>The couple first met at a restaurant in Huntington, New York, when they were both out with friends. After they exchanged phone numbers, he called her from across the restaurant to ask if she would give him a ride home. She agreed, and he invited her in when they arrived at his house. Billy then insisted on playing a song for her after she initially shut down the idea. “It was like he couldn’t not be ‘Billy Joel’ at the moment,” Alexis told <a href=#>The New Yorker</a> while reflecting on their first meeting in 2014.</p><h2>How Many Children Does Billy Joel Have?</h2><p>Billy is a dad-of-three as of last October 2017!He has a daughter Alexa Ray with Christie, and two daughters, Della Rose and Remy, with Alexis.</p><p>While Billy likes to keep his personal life out of the spotlight, he clearly has a close bond with his children. Alexis, Della and Remy even paid tribute to him on Father’s Day in 2022 with a post shared via his official <a href=#>Facebook page</a>. “The best dads are always ready to ride! Happy Father’s Day to our #1 and too many Uncles to count!” the family wrote alongside several group photos. “Love, your very grateful girl gang.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46hprBlnZa7unnToqSeq12Xtq242GahqJ2cYrqivtGinJ1lYWmBeoWPaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
