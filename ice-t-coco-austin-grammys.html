The tribute included performances from Grandmaster Flash, Missy Elliott, Latifah, Run-D.M.C., Salt-N-Pepa, LL Cool J Nelly, Public Enemy and Busta Rhymes.</p><p>While the medley was hailed as one of the best performances in Grammy history, Ice-T admitted he was initially hesitant about being a part of the showcase.</p><p>"Questlove calls me up and he says, 'All right, you gotta come to L.A. this weekend... It's a big performance, I got you in the lineup,'" he recalled to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a>. "And I was still hesitant 'cause it's a long travel, But then he says, 'You don't want to be sitting at home watching this show, saying you should've been there. I was invited but I didn't show up.' And [so] I got my Black a-- on a plane."</p><p>The actor gushed about how happy he felt "to see all these legends together and you're not here for a funeral."</p><p>"Real talk, unfortunately, that's usually the only time we all get together and see each other," Ice-T confessed. "So the Grammys brought us together and it's so crazy that for a while, rap wasn't even represented at the Grammys. I got one of the early grammys with Quincy Jones, you know, but I felt Quincy kinda snuck us in the backdoor."</p><a id=gallery-link-829f9751-7d50-4377-a07e-070ebd448e2e class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:829f9751-7d50-4377-a07e-070ebd448e2e data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:3d70ceca-cf5b-4f5b-857e-bee1ff51472f data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/84/4by3/2023/02/06/84f52748e41748609479d6d1504cf075_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2tmaW9fnrCmedNmmqibn2Kutr%2FToqVmn6KWuq7F0mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
