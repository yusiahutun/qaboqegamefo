Say goodbye to your tailor, folks, because the best stores for petite women are here to save the day. For anyone under 5’4″ (myself included), shopping—and especially online shopping—can be ridiculously difficult.

For anyone under 5’4″ (myself included), shopping—and especially&nbsp;online shopping—can be ridiculously difficult. I’ve become BFFs with size charts, always checking to see how long the “cropped” pants I’m eyeing&nbsp;actually are or if a midi dress will look like a floor-length gown on me. For those who are constantly having to get their clothing altered or just forego shopping all-together, I’m here to let you know there are plenty of <a href=# id=auto-tag_petite data-tag=petite>petite</a>-friendly (!) places to <a href=# id=auto-tag_shop data-tag=shop>shop</a>.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kentucky-derby-2.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/buffing-bar.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>Honestly, the day I discovered <a href=# rel=noopener><span class=s2><a href=# id=auto-tag_petite-clothing data-tag=petite-clothing>petite clothing</a></span></a> was truly a game-changer. I try to buy petites whenever I can—especially in bottoms—because they make life so much easier. If you’ve ever known the pain of seeing a cute pair of jeans, a jumpsuit or maxi dress that you wanted but <i>knew</i> it would just be too long, I definitely feel your pain. It can make shopping in-person with friends a frustrating experience. And while many brands still don’t carry petite sizes in their stores, they often have petite sections online that you can shop. It’s not a perfect situation, but I’ll take it (for now, at least).</span></p><p><span class=s1>Of course, as someone who also wears plus sizes in certain items of clothing, I’ve also learned that <a href=# rel=noopener>petites in extended sizes</a> are typically not readily available. I could go on about this for years (and years), but I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention it—especially because it’s likely many of you petite folks also fall outside the classic straight-size range. There are a few go-to options if you wear above a size 12 (and you’ll find them below), but the fashion industry can definitely do better.&nbsp;</span></p><p>That being said, all my shorties to front, please! Keep reading for the ultimate list of <a href=# rel=noopener>stores for petite women</a>. You might want to bookmark this for later, too—and keep it as a guide whenever you’re ready to shop ’til you drop.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1><i>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

The <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Ella by Rafaella collection</a> has cute and comfortable workwear that will take you from the office to happy hour and back. I particularly love this <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">dropped waist dress</a> that will actually&nbsp;hit at the right length.</p><h2>2. Topshop</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/best-stores-for-petite-women-topshop.png><p>For all things trendy, you can’t skip over <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Topshop’s petite section</a>. Jeans, tops, skirts and dresses abound on the brand’s site, making it easy AF to find a new and on-trend ensemble.

ASOS</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/best-stores-for-petite-women-asos.png><p>ASOS has everything from maternity sizes to tall and plus sizes—and, of course, plenty of petite options too.
