He is the only American cast member in the HBO series Game Of Thrones (GOT).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Peter-Dinklage-640x422.jpg><p>Peter Dinklage has certainly proven himself to be a special talent, as evidenced by his casting as Tyrion Lannister on the hit show Game of Thrones. His unique abilities were recognized even before he made it big in Hollywood; growing up next door to Bruce Springsteen, Peter was invited over to play guitar for his mother – although she wasn’t particularly impressed! It’s clear that Peter is one-of-a-kind and destined for greatness.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Taylor Lautner Fat: Facts About His Body And Weight Gain</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Peter-Dinklage-1.jpg><p>When he was new to the business he had to learn how to say no and he got pretty good at it. He has never accepted degrading roles that go along with being a dwarf and his career is very successful. The star has a very mixed pedigree he has English German and Irish blood…. so he fits in a certain way exactly to the actors of GOT.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Peter-Dinklage-game-of-thrones.jpg><p>We love it when our stars show how fantastic they are by performing on Sesame Street in other words Peter Dinklage was on Sesame Street. Although he plays a tough ass at GOT he couldn’t be any different than his sword-wielding character. He absolutely hates swordplay but it pays the bills.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Peter-Dinklage-Find-Me-Guilty.jpg><p>Before we get carried away because we were on our way there let us move on to the subject at hand beginning with the height of Peter Dinklage.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Danny DeVito’s Height, Weight And Body Measurements</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Peter Dinklage’s Height</strong></h2><p>Ok it is quite obvious that the star is not quite on the high side but he is living proof that height is not exactly the recipe for excitement fulfillment or success. He stands 4 feet and 5 inches high and he swings every foot/inch he has. He dropped his actual height in a BBC interview once and that’s what he said: ‘There are a lot of people in much worse shape than me. I’m 4 feet 5 inches and it’s a part of what I am only not the whole part.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/peter-dinklage-emmy-awards.jpg><p>As usual, there are people out there who seriously doubt that the star is actually as big as his stated height; some think he counted his height when he is in shoes and not barefoot. The cool thing about these naysayers is that they take care to be diplomatic when it comes to writing off his height and that’s people how great Peter Dinklage is.</p><p>Here’s a list of celebrities who share Peter Dinklage’s height. Darcy Rose Byrnes Janette Tough and Dylan Post AKA Hornswoggle are all as big as the star.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Peter Dinklage’s Weight</strong></h2><p>Of course, we don’t expect it to weigh so much for obvious reasons but out of curiosity we can see how the star rolls in the weight section. Peter weighs 51 kilograms and it only says in the stars that he makes every kilogram look good.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Peter-Dinklage-Height-1.jpg><p>Apart from the fact that it would be totally criminal if he were not in this weight range, there are definitely a few other factors that influence the star’s weight. First Peter has pretty good eating habits as he is a strict vegetarian. Yes, he said he loves animals and can’t imagine eating any of them be it a cow a goat, or a chicken.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Peter-Dinklage’s-Weight.jpg><p>He is also a dedicated PETA supporter so he summarizes his eating habits.
