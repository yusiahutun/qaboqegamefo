A standard 12-ounce (355 ml) can of Coke Zero contains <b>0 calories</b>, making it an appealing option for those looking to reduce their calorie intake or maintain their weight.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-2>No Sugar</h2><p>Coke Zero is specifically designed to mimic the taste of traditional Coca-Cola without the added <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# title=sugar data-wpil-keyword-link=linked data-wpel-link=internal>sugar</a>. As a result, it contains <b>0 grams </b>of sugar per serving. This can be beneficial for individuals looking to reduce their sugar intake or manage their blood sugar levels.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-3>Artificial Sweeteners</h2><p>To achieve its sweet taste without the use of sugar, Coke Zero relies on artificial sweeteners. The primary sweeteners used in Coke Zero are <b>aspartame</b> and <b>acesulfame potassium</b>. Both of these sweeteners have been deemed safe for consumption by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other international regulatory agencies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/coca-cola-zero-can-730x438.jpeg><p>Read also: <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><span>10 Don Pablos Nutrition Facts</span></a></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-4>Contains Caffeine</h2><p>Like many other soft drinks, Coke Zero contains <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>caffeine</a>. A 12-ounce (355 ml) can of Coke Zero has approximately <b>34 milligrams </b>of caffeine. While this is a moderate amount of caffeine, it’s still important to monitor your caffeine intake, particularly if you are sensitive to its effects.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-5>Phosphoric Acid</h2><p>Coke Zero contains <b>phosphoric acid</b>, an ingredient commonly found in many soft drinks. Phosphoric acid is used to add tartness and act as a preservative. However, excessive consumption of phosphoric acid may contribute to the erosion of tooth enamel and has been linked to a potentially increased risk of osteoporosis.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-6>Low Sodium</h2><p>Coke Zero is low in sodium, with a 12-ounce (355 ml) serving containing just <b>40 milligrams </b>of sodium. This represents approximately 2% of the recommended daily allowance for sodium, making it a suitable option for individuals looking to reduce their sodium intake.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-7>Carbonation</h2><p>Like traditional Coca-Cola, Coke Zero is a carbonated beverage. Carbonation can cause bloating and gas for some individuals, particularly when consumed in large quantities. If you are sensitive to carbonated beverages, it’s important to consume Coke Zero in moderation.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-8>Contains Caramel Color</h2><p>Coke Zero gets its dark color from the addition of <b>caramel color</b>. While the FDA considers caramel color safe for consumption, there is an ongoing debate about the potential health risks associated with its use, particularly in regards to a byproduct called 4-MEI. However, current research indicates that the levels of 4-MEI present in caramel color are too low to pose a significant risk to human health.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-9>Potassium Benzoate</h2><p>Coke Zero contains potassium benzoate, a common preservative used in soft drinks. While it is generally considered safe for consumption, some studies have suggested a potential link between benzoate-containing beverages and an increased risk of hyperactivity in children. However, more research is needed to establish a definitive connection.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Woman-hand-choosing-Coca-cola-coke-zero-cold-soft-drink.jpeg><p>Read also: <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><span>10 CroissanWich Nutrition Facts</span></a></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-10>Potential Impact on Blood Sugar</h2><p>While Coke Zero contains no sugar, there is some debate over whether artificial sweeteners like <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# title=aspartame data-wpil-keyword-link=linked data-wpel-link=internal>aspartame</a> and acesulfame potassium can have an impact on blood sugar levels. Some studies suggest that these sweeteners may trigger an <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# title=insulin data-wpil-keyword-link=linked data-wpel-link=internal>insulin</a> response, while others have found no significant effect. As a result, it’s important to monitor your blood sugar levels if you have diabetes or other blood sugar-related concerns.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-11>Not a Source of Nutrients</h2><p>Coke Zero is not a significant source of vitamins, minerals, or other essential nutrients. While it may be a low-calorie and sugar-free alternative to traditional Coca-Cola, it should still not be relied upon as a source of <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# title=nutrition data-wpil-keyword-link=linked data-wpel-link=internal>nutrition</a>. Instead, health-conscious individuals should focus on consuming a balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrient-rich foods.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-12>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, Coke Zero can be a suitable option for individuals looking to reduce their calorie and sugar intake without sacrificing the taste of Coca-Cola. However, it’s essential to consume it in moderation and be aware of the potential health concerns associated with some of its ingredients. As always, it’s important to prioritize a balanced and nutritious diet for optimal health and well-being.</p><h3>Was this page helpful?</h3><p class=why-trust><span>Our commitment to delivering trustworthy and engaging content is at the heart of what we do.
