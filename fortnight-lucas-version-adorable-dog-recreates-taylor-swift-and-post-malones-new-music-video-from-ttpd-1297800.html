While talking about the song after the music video’s premiere, she said in an Instagram post, “When I was writing the Fortnight music video, I wanted to show you the worlds I saw in my head that served as the backdrop for making this music.&nbsp; Pretty much everything in it is a metaphor or a reference to one corner of the album or another. For me, this video turned out to be the perfect visual representation of this record and the stories I tell in it.”</p><p>She also thanked her co-artist Post Malone in the post by saying he “blew me away on set as our tortured tragic hero and I’m so grateful to him for everything he put into this collaboration.” She added, “I’m still laughing from getting to work with the coolest guys on earth, @ethanhawke and @mrjoshcharles (tortured poets, meet your colleagues from down the hall, the dead poets),” thanking the actors who featured on the music video.</p><p class=also_read_style><strong>ALSO READ:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# onclick='triggerCommentfollowAlsoClick("article_also_read_click","Fortnight (Lucas&#39; Version): Adorable Dog Recreates Taylor Swift And Post Malone&#39;s New Music Video From TTPD",1297800,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/i-am-beyond-honored-post-malone-lauds-taylor-swift-after-fortnight-feature-on-the-tortured-poets-department-1297768","articlepage","/entertainment/hollywood/fortnight-lucas-version-adorable-dog-recreates-taylor-swift-and-post-malones-new-music-video-from-ttpd-1297800","Content Also read","entertainment","hollywood"),triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Fortnight (Lucas&#39; Version): Adorable Dog Recreates Taylor Swift And Post Malone&#39;s New Music Video From TTPD",1297800,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/i-am-beyond-honored-post-malone-lauds-taylor-swift-after-fortnight-feature-on-the-tortured-poets-department-1297768","articlepage","/entertainment/hollywood/fortnight-lucas-version-adorable-dog-recreates-taylor-swift-and-post-malones-new-music-video-from-ttpd-1297800",&#39;&#39;,I,Am,Beyond,Honored,": Post Malone Lauds Taylor Swift After Fortnight Feature On The Tortured Poets Department","Also_Read","entertainment","hollywood")'><strong>'I Am Beyond Honored': Post Malone Lauds Taylor Swift After Fortnight Feature On The Tortured Poets Department</strong></a></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX528rbjYsKaonF%2BbvLPAzaKeoaxdocKkrdJmrZ6qo568r3nAnaarmZKhsm6wzqBkq52Tp7KiwMSsZK2ZqaG8s3nSsKCfrF2Wu6V5z6iqrWWdlrmwusSsZKedp2K6tr%2FInGSvoZSavG6y0aikZqykpbFufZFybnFoYA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
