Historical instances of human meat consumption were symbolic or religious gestures.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-7>A typical human male ejaculation contains 150 mg of protein.</h2><p><span>The sperm also contains a protein that encourages women to ovulate.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-8>Proteins often cause allergies.</h2><p><span>Certain foods often cause allergies because the structure of their protein contents triggers immune responses. For example, many people are allergic to gluten, a protein found in wheat and grains.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-9>Most microorganisms and plants are capable of synthesizing all 20 standard amino acids.</h2><p><span>However, animals and humans can only get 9 of these essential amino acids through <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>food</a>.</span></p><p>Read also: <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><span>11 Unbelievable Facts About Cerebellum</span></a></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-10>Low-sodium parmesan cheese is the richest in protein.</h2><p><span>Dairy products such as milk, yogurt, and cheese are all sources of protein, but this particular cheese has the richest protein content. Low-sodium parmesan cheese contains 41.6 grams per 100 grams serving.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-11>Tuna has the highest protein content for fish.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cannibals-3124433_1920-1024x734.jpg><p><span>Bluefin and yellowfin tuna are especially rich in protein. Bluefin offers 29.91 grams of protein per 100 grams of dry-cooked fish, and yellowfin provides 29.15 grams. A few other contenders are the following: anchovies (29 gr), salmon (27 g), halibut (27 g) and tilapia (26 grams).</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-12>Seeds are a protein-rich snack.</h2><p><span>Pumpkin seeds provide 33 grams of protein per 100 grams, while watermelon seeds provide around 28 grams per 100 grams.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-13>Protein keeps your body from swelling up.</h2><p><span>The protein albumin keeps the entire human body from being swollen from liquids.&nbsp; In third world countries, protein diet and lack of food are common problems that cause the swelling of the abdomen from the lack of albumin and osmotic imbalance of body fluids.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-14>Once protein is digested, it is broken down into its amino acids.</h2><p><span>These amino acids are then reused to make the proteins your body needs to maintain muscles, bones, </span><span>blood</span><span>, and body organs.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-15>Eating excessive protein can damage your organs.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tuna-fish-954073_1920-1024x692.jpg><p><span>Eating excessive protein than required will put stress on the </span><span>kidneys</span><span> and </span><span>liver</span><span> because these organs will work harder to break down the extra protein. Not only this, but the broken down protein will then be stored as body fat and result in weight gain.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-16>Protein can be fatal.</h2><p><span>There has been one recorded death from protein consumption: A 20-year-old hockey athlete died from ammonia poisoning due to a high-protein diet. Ammonia poisoning isn’t really an effect of too much protein, but in this case, the athlete had a rare genetic condition that prevents his body from metabolizing and synthesizing protein properly. The protein turned into ammonia in his system and ended up poisoning him.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-17>Sonic the Hedgehog is a protein.</h2><p><span>Gotta go fast! Sonic hedgehog is a </span><span>secreted</span><span> protein crucial to the development of animals and humans. It is responsible for the growth of digits and <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>brain</a> organization.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-18>Pikachu is also a protein.</h2><p><span>Pikachurin is a retinal protein named after the lightning Pokemon, Pikachu for its nimbleness. Good pikachurin bonds are crucial to good eyesight. Misaligned or misshapen bonds cause <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>eye</a> ailments.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-19>Turkey breast is the leanest part of the animal.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/human-digestive-system-163714_1280-1024x576.jpg><p><span>An 85 gram serving of roasted, skinless <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>turkey</a> breast contains 24 grams of protein and 115 calories. It is also rich in niacin, vitamin B6, selenium, phosphorus, and zinc.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-20>Middle-aged people need to consume more protein.</h2><p><span>Because protein is essential for cell regeneration, many researchers argue that protein is the main reason for aging.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-21>Collagen is the most abundant protein in your body.</h2><p><span>This is the main structural component of ligaments, bones, skin, and muscles.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-22>Protein keeps chicken eggs sturdy.</h2><p><span>A special form of keratin keeps <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>eggshells</a> firm.

You could say that they’re the life of the party.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-25>There’s a giant protein…</h2><p><span>Titin is the biggest discovered protein. It is also known as connectin and is responsible for muscle contraction.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-26>… and its chemical name has 189,819 letters!</h2><p><span>Overall, it takes about 3.5 hours to pronounce. Good luck with that.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-27>The smallest protein in the human body is the thyroid releasing hormone (TRH).</h2><p><span>The thyroid releasing hormone has only 234 amino acids. Meanwhile, the smallest polypeptide in the human body is insulin at 54 amino acids.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-28>Protein bars aren’t a meal substitute.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/exercise-2099096_1280-1024x786.png><p><span>Good protein bars should ideally have 8 to 10 grams of protein, about 3 grams of fiber, and balanced sugar amounts. However, man can’t live on protein bar or protein shake alone. You’d need the other macronutrients to keep yourself <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>healthy</a>.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-29>Myosins are motor proteins in charge of muscle contraction.</h2><p><span>These proteins transmit signals to the rest of your <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>body</a> and result in motion.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-30>Hormones are proteins.</h2><p><span>Hormones are signaling protein molecules that are transported by the circulatory system to send commands that regulate physiology and behavior.</span></p><h3>Was this page helpful?</h3><p class=why-trust><span>Our commitment to delivering trustworthy and engaging content is at the heart of what we do.
