But the couple's only child, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://mallorylewisandlambchop.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mallory Lewis" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Mallory Lewis</a>, paints a different picture, stating her mother struggled with being both the breadwinner and an adoring wife. Her father's obsession with counterculture interests, like New Age spirituality, meanwhile, clashed with her mother's levelheaded nature.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"My father was an unsuccessful television producer and my mom was the toast of New York City." <span aria-hidden=true class="css-fkadry eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Though Tarcher is often credited as a producer of Lewis's shows, Mallory says it was in name only. "He was creative and she enjoyed having him as a sounding board and contributor [but] she was in charge because the matter of fact was it was her ass on stage," says Mallory. Lewis and Tarcher's union withstood the trials of cancer, drug use, and a volatile entertainment industry, all during "a really interesting time in our nation's social history," says Mallory, speaking of the hippie, civil rights, and feminist movements that began in the '60s and rippled into the '90s. The ways she sees it, their 40-year marriage was nothing short of a miracle.</p><img alt="Formal wear, Suit, Tuxedo, Eyewear, Hairstyle, Dress, Glasses, Little black dress, Fun, Event, " title="Formal wear, Suit, Tuxedo, Eyewear, Hairstyle, Dress, Glasses, Little black dress, Fun, Event, " width=682 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/26/1498686541-shari-lewis-and-tarcher-circa-1970jpg.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Getty Images</span><p>Lewis and Tarcher, circa 1970</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="dropcap css-1ez97s8 et3p2gv0">Twenty-four-year-old Shari Lewis was hosting her own local show, Shariland, on New York's WRCA-TV, when the couple met. One of Jeremy Tarcher's old Army buddies was slated to appear on Shari's show and he invited Tarcher, 25, along to the taping. "My father was an unsuccessful television producer and my mom was the toast of New York City," Mallory tells CountryLiving.com. "He did not think his friend's performance was very good but he thought the little redhead was hot so he asked her out."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Lewis, nee Hurwitz, had been married briefly in her late teens, to advertising executive Stan Lewis, a union that had <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/puppeteer-shari-lewis-dies/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="ended badly" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">ended badly</a>. Not necessarily on the market for anything serious, she nonetheless found Tarcher intriguing. "I thought he was the most elegant man I'd ever met," Lewis told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://people.com/archive/master-puppeteer-shari-lewis-publisher-jeremy-tarcher-its-not-a-match-between-dummies-vol-5-no-4/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">People</a> in 1976.

"My mom wanted to make sure she could swipe left if she wanted to at the end of drinks, so they only made plans for drinks." Tarcher hoped the evening would continue, but Lewis already had a dinner date lined up with another suitor. "Then I'm sure he won't mind if I join you," Tarcher responded. He accompanied Lewis on her date, and it was the last time she ever went out with anyone else.</p><img alt="Shari Lewis and Mallory Tarcher" title="Shari Lewis and Mallory Tarcher" width=766 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/26/1498686820-shari-lewis-newborn-baby-mallory.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Getty Images</span><p>Lewis and newborn Mallory</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="dropcap css-1ez97s8 et3p2gv0">The couple married on March 18, 1958, just as Lewis's career was heating up. Her first network children's program, The Shari Lewis Show, replaced Howdy Doody on NBC in 1960. Lewis, a talented ventriloquist who invented the sock puppet Lamb Chop and her pals Charlie Horse and Hush Puppy, filled their home with similar plush characters. "You can't open one of the doors without being conked by a rabbit or an elephant," Tarcher told Cue magazine in 1958.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Their first and only child, daughter Mallory, came along in 1963. For her, childhood consisted of growing up in a home of 60 puppets and sleeping next to Lamb Chop every night. "It's not the same thing as brothers and sisters," Lewis once said, "but it's all she got."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Lewis and Tarcher's biggest collaboration, besides their daughter, came in 1968 when they penned an episode of Star Trek together, season three's "Lights of Zetar." Mallory calls it "arguably one of the most boring episodes ever," but it introduced Memory Alpha, a planet where all of the universe's knowledge is stored, which later became the name of the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Portal:Main data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="encyclopedia for all things Star Trek" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">encyclopedia for all things Star Trek</a>. Lewis originally wrote he role of Lieutenant Mira Romaine for herself, says Mallory: "At the last minute, the producer/director's girlfriend got it. I don't think she's ever been madder about something."</p><img alt="Shari Lewis and daughter Mallory" title="Shari Lewis and daughter Mallory" width=1024 height=681 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/26/1498687164-lewis-and-mallory-1970.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Getty Images</span><p>Lewis, Mallory, and Lamb Chop in 1970</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">As a working woman who came of age in an era when being a wife and mother was considered a woman's paramount role, Mallory says, Lewis was extremely conflicted. "She was earning way more than my dad ever earned," says Mallory. "When she wasn't performing, she was writing books, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://people.com/archive/lamb-chops-shari-lewis-has-more-talents-than-you-can-shake-a-stick-at-and-conducting-is-one-vol-19-no-20/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="conducting symphonies" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">conducting symphonies</a>, or handling licensing and merchandising deals. My dad would show up at home at the end of the day looking for food.

The experience inspired Tarcher to start his own book publishing firm, where he brought to market titles that addressed human consciousness and potential, such as Marilyn Ferguson's <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/dp/158542742X data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Aquarian Conspiracy" data-vars-ga-product-id=787db388-4acc-4380-be9e-3467e2c10622 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale_t | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/158542742X data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/158542742X data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/158542742X data-affiliate-network='{"id":"f2d19a9b-88b2-4e2b-b0f4-2bcc1aef8ac8","site_id":"f30f2c6f-2363-4b03-b482-ae642b94f911","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-brand=Tarcherperigee data-vars-ga-product-price=$14.69 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=55dddf43-5edf-471e-95ef-4f1f4933ea20 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=Tarcherperigee data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category="Personal Transformation" data-optimizely-button-poc=_t class="body-link product-links css-a3mbhf ebsw2pb0">The Aquarian Conspiracy</a>.</p><img alt="Shari Lewis and Jeremy Tarcher 1970" title="Shari Lewis and Jeremy Tarcher" width=940 height=713 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/26/1498750231-shari-lewis-jeremy-tarcher-party-1970.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Getty Images</span><p>Lewis and Tarcher, center, at a party in 1970</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">His seeker's nature fueled experimentation in other areas of his life too, and by the time Mallory was a teenager, in the mid '70s, her father was entrenched in the psychedelic drug scene. "That did not go over well with my mother," Mallory recalls. "She was not a fan of the Birkenstock wearing, granola eating, Esalen stuff. She's a New Yorker, through and through."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Still, Lewis and Tarcher remained an affectionate couple with a deep respect for each other. It's one of the greatest lessons Mallory has taken from her parents' marriage. "They were always extremely polite to each other," she says. "In our family, if you're sitting in the living room and you get up to go to kitchen, you say to the other person who's still in the living room, is there anything I can get you? And the other person responds, 'yes, please' or 'no, thank you.' It's a lot further from 'yes, dear' to 'get the hell out of my house' than it is from 'yeah' to 'get the hell out of my house.'"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="dropcap css-1ez97s8 et3p2gv0">Husband and wife faced another obstacle in 1984 when they learned <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.cancertodaymag.org/SUmmer2015/Pages/Shari-Lewis-Voice-of-Lamb-Chop-Breast-Uterine-Cancer.aspx data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lewis had breast cancer" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Lewis had breast cancer</a>. Never one to lose control, Lewis took it upon herself to research the best plan of action, and chose lumpectomy, radiation, and medication rather than the mastectomy her doctors recommended. "She decided what was good for Shari, she put together her own [regimen], and followed it carefully," Tarcher once said during a TV interview.</p><img alt="Shari Lewis and Jeremy Tarcher 1996" title="Shari Lewis and Jeremy Tarcher 1996" width=1024 height=661 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/26/1498752513-shari-lewis-childrens-museum-nyc-1996-2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Getty Images</span><p>Lewis and Tarcher at the Children\'s Museum of Manhattan in 1996</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">"Life presents all kinds of challenges at whatever age," Lewis told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.grandtimes.com/lambchop.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Grand Times" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Grand Times</a> in 1997. "Having handled [cancer], you get a sense that whatever comes you'll handle."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Not one to slow down, Lewis remained a staple in children's television. In the '90s, the family moved to Vancouver to produce Lamb Chop's Play-Along, which aired on PBS from 1992 to 1997. Mallory served as the show's co-writer and co-producer. It was during those years that the couples' shared passion for adventure became evident. Lewis once convinced the Vancouver aquarium to let them swim with some of its star mammals. "My dad didn't want to swim with the beluga whales," Mallory laughs. "He was the less adventurous of the two but mom sort of dragged him along on these wonderful opportunities she would get with Lamb Chop." They were also among the handful of people invited to visit the rare gorillas of the southeast Asian islands of Borneo—one of the gorillas' caretakers loved Lamp Chop so much he named a baby gorilla after her.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"My dad was as much in love with my mom as he had the emotional capacity to be."<span aria-hidden=true class="css-fkadry eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Lewis and Tarcher came up with the idea for a Play-Along spinoff while talking about children's favorite things: music, pizza, and the beach, they decided. Lewis was working on The Charlie Horse Music Pizza when she began feeling abdominal pains. Knowing her mother wasn't the type of person to complain, Mallory pushed her to see a doctor. That's when Lewis learned she had uterine cancer; the drug she took during breast cancer treatment, tamoxifen, is now known to increase the risk of uterine cancer. She died two months later, on Aug. 2, 1998, from pneumonia she developed while undergoing chemotherapy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">"My mom was as every bit in love with my dad at the end as she was in the beginning," says Mallory, "and I think my dad was in as much in love as he had the emotional capacity to be."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=53 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">"When he lost her, he realized how irreplaceable she was," she continues, offering up his quick remarriage to an "absolute horror" as proof of her father's need to fill the void.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=55 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">At the request of fans, Mallory resurrected the Lamb Chop show shortly after her mother's passing. She also changed her last name to Lewis in honor of her mom. "It's very hard not to take for granted what you have," she says, "but I would say my parents' story was a love story."</p><h6 class="css-5zz7ok e6pr2lz3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e6pr2lz1">Related Stories</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLvUp6ursZyew6q6xmeaqKVfobansY6epa2doqmuqrrMnqWtZ5FpgHh%2FlmiqoZminnqtsdaiqmalkae%2Fqq3GnmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
