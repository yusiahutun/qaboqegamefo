Whether it’s a pair of pants that transition seamlessly from work to the weekend or a cute dress that’s as comfortable as pajamas, the <a href=# rel=noopener>Universal Standard July 2020 sample sale</a> is the perfect way to stock up on essentials in all (and we mean all) sizes. ICYMI, the brand has become the most size-inclusive women’s clothing retailer in the world (!!), offering sizes 00 through 40 in every single piece on their site. The brand was already affordable, too, but with their summer sample sale, the deals are even hotter than the rising temperatures—so we best get on it.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>If you’ve never shopped at <a href=# id=auto-tag_universal-standard data-tag=universal-standard>Universal Standard</a> before, you’re in for a treat.

Size-inclusive technology for the win.</p><p>Though it’s always a good idea to pop onto the Universal Standard website and take a peek at what they’re offering, right now is an especially perfect time, thanks to the slashed prices in the brand’s sample sale.

Tops are starting at just $4, bottoms at $24, dresses at $28 and workwear at $48, so now&nbsp;really is the ideal time to stock up on pieces you’ll wear for years.</p><p>Just because these pieces are <a href=# rel=noopener>wardrobe basics</a>, though, doesn’t mean they’re boring. Universal Standard has turned pieces you wear all the time into clothing that you’ll actually&nbsp;want to wear all the time.
