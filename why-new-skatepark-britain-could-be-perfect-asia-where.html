Skateboarding was included in the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, and when it debuted as an Olympic sport at the Tokyo Summer Games in 2021, Japan took five of 12 medals, with two going to the US, where skateboarding had its mid-20th-century street roots in free-spirited California."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

When skateboarders first started clattering around Hong Kong plazas in the 1980s, they were moved on by security, and notices went up to deter them. The Leisure and Cultural Services Department was initially sceptical about skateparks, but eventually approved one in Lai Chi Kok Park that opened in 2000. Now Hong Kong has almost 20.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Skateboarding was included in the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, and when it debuted as an Olympic sport at the Tokyo Summer Games in 2021, Japan took five of 12 medals, with two going to the US, where skateboarding had its mid-20th-century street roots in free-spirited California.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The number of skateboarders, now in the millions, continues to grow, so demand for skateparks will almost certainly increase. That presents a challenge in a dense city like Hong Kong, where space is at a premium.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Architect Guy Hollaway has a solution. He says that “the concept of the multistorey skatepark enables you to place the building in the heart of a city, where it is accessible by public transport and can be enjoyed by many more young people”. The first such facility he designed opened in April, not in Asia but the small English seaside town of Folkestone. The dramatically jutting, angular building called F51 offers three stacked levels of skatepark.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/03/a5a1900d-4c44-4854-9661-af6fe784f790_775541f0.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hollaway, the founder of the UK-based architectural practice Hollaway Studio, is adamant to share the credit with the tycoon who instigated the scheme, Sir Roger de Haan, founder of the Saga Group, which provides products for the over-50s. “He’s like a wannabe architect and he gets involved,” says Hollaway.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Both men had concluded that a proposed multistorey car park for the site looked “boring”, and de Haan asked for a skatepark to be integrated. The design evolved until, as Hollaway says, “this idea of a multistorey skatepark was born”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">F51 sits besides Folkestone’s Creative Quarter, where quaint, colourful old buildings line steep streets. The new 3,250 sq m (35,000 sq ft) building could not be more different. Sheathed in crushed metal penetrated by small triangular windows, the building has an angular shape that tapers outwards, the sharp rounded corner facing the sea not unlike a ship’s prow cutting a path towards it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Curved concrete bulges over the entrance and undulations across the ground floor’s fluid ceiling indicate the undersides of “bowls” in the skatepark on the floor above. Behind the reception desk and cafe counter, the wall is lined with skateboards printed with art from local brands and creatives.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But F51 is not all skateboarding. Boxing facilities lie beyond the reception area, and from the first floor, 600 sq m of climbing wall rises three storeys towards skylights in the roof.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">When Hong Kong’s Kowloon Tong interchange linked two rail systems in 1982</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">BMX bikers are welcome on the skatepark and, Hollaway notes, they affected the design: “Bikes can cover greater distance and travel through the air further and higher, so it’s pretty critical that floor-to-ceiling heights are right.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The first-floor skatepark, designed by specialists Maverick Skateparks, is cast in concrete and includes a monster bowl 2.9m deep with a rim lined with mosaic. This is a nod to the swimming pools of LA’s Dogtown area, which local skaters famously plunged into in 1976/77.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The skateparks on the second and third floors are larger because the building gets wider, but they are gentler. Both are crafted by specialists Cambian Action, which applied artisan skills to the plywood surfacing. The material is much more sustainable than concrete, and as Hollaway says, wood “gives you friction, it’s easier”. The total skateable area is 1,873 sq m.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/03/b48b888e-9968-4573-a015-1d6ddc1142a0_b985a036.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The split across three levels affords freedom in programming so that a floor may be time-allocated to beginners, professionals or competitions. Female-only usage slots are important, because girls drive much of the sport’s growth worldwide. At the games in Tokyo, two 13-year-old girls took gold and silver medals, suggesting longer careers ahead of them and a further skewing away from the male dominance the sport once had. Hong Kong requires Olympic competitors to be 18 years or older.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">F51’s skatepark levels are unheated but sealed to the outside, because as Holloway says, “after investigating the impact of weather, the decision was made to shroud the building in a waterproof facade. The slightest bit of moisture on the concrete bowls can render the surface unskatable.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hong Kong’s skateparks are open air (with a rare exception of Sk85ive2 in Kwun Tong), but weatherproofing would be a game-changer, especially during hot, wet summers. In Folkestone, air is constantly refreshed to remove the heat and CO2 generated from the sport inside, and the controlled internal climate also guarantees competition and events.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If you’ve got people flying in from America to skate, they can’t be told it’s not open,” says Hollaway.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since the 1994 opening of the London-Paris Eurostar train service spelt the end of Folkestone’s role as the railway gateway to France, de Haan has been central to the town’s revival. Fostering the Creative Quarter and bringing development to the Harbour are two examples, but F51 is something different. Hollaway calls it “generational regeneration. It’s making sure that the next generation have something for themselves.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/03/65abf05b-74fd-486f-b114-af51d26ba265_f41fe037.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Now that a multistorey skatepark has been realised, he adds, there is a future for similar facilities beyond Folkestone.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In cities such as Hong Kong where land is scarce and of high value, this design provides an opportunity to make the sports more accessible and inclusive.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZK6zwNJmmq6kpKq%2FpnvAq6uim5yafHR9lm9qb2lfrLW6ec2ermarm5bBprzAq6JmmqKewaK1zWaaqK2cmXqjsYypnKuelZjBbq3Sophmr5iav6Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
