By the early part of the 20th century, the theater had fallen into disuse but was reopened in early 2018 after undergoing extensive renovations.</p><p>Today, the theater features the 400-capacity Black Box theater, as well as the smaller Burn Box lounge and an adjacent art gallery.</p><p>“We are very excited to partner with Logjam at the Rialto,” said Matthew Beehler, General Manager for the Rialto. “Our goal has always been to bring great acts to Bozeman, and we believe this new partnership will help us deliver on that. We’re so proud of what we’ve built at the Rialto, and want to ensure the venue is a vibrant part of downtown Bozeman. We believe Logjam will help us build a pipeline of great live music, comedy and other live performances that will take advantage of all the venue has to offer. While we hope to increase the frequency of acts, the Rialto will continue to host private events and be managed and operated by Columbia Hospitality.”</p><p>“Logjam is excited to partner with the Rialto to bring world-class artists to Bozeman. With the renovations made to the Rialto in 2018, the Rialto offers a best-in-class, 500 capacity venue to promote and produce live events for the Bozeman community. Having a venue of this quality will allow us to add many of the shows we currently bring into the Missoula market into Bozeman,” said Nick Checota, owner of Logjam Presents.</p><p>The agreement will be effective starting September 1, 2019.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZoZwfJRoaG5nnKS0q63MZqqin56oeqbEwqWsrKGmmnqlscClZLChpJ16tbTEZqmimZypvG7Ax56YraqVYravecGosZ6lkaN8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
