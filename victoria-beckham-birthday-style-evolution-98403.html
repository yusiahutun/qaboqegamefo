Over the years, the singer-turned-designer’s style evolution has continued to prove she has the best taste in wardrobe.</p><p>Victoria, who was born on April 17, 1974, rose to fame at age 20 when she was chosen as a member of the Spice Girls. The England native, who was in the hit group with <strong>Mel B</strong>, <strong>Mel C</strong>, <strong>Emma Bunton</strong> and <strong>Geri Halliwell</strong>, reached Hollywood superstardom with the release of their debut album, Spice, in 1996.</p><p>Victoria and the rest of the Spice Girls became a cultural phenomenon as they released a second album, Spiceworld, in 1997. That same year, the fashion mogul and her bandmates appeared in Spice World: The Movie.</p><p>While she was at the peak of her career, Victoria fell in love with <a href=#><strong>David Beckham</strong></a>. The Victoria Beckham brand owner and the former professional soccer star met in 1997 and quickly became an exclusive item known to the world as “Posh and Becks.”</p><p>In March 1999, the famous lovebirds welcomed their eldest son, <a href=#>Brooklyn</a>, and four months later in July, they tied the knot during a luxurious wedding ceremony at a castle outside Dublin. Victoria and David went on to have three more kids: <a href=#>Romeo</a> in 2002, <a href=#>Cruz</a> in 2005, and daughter <a href=#>Harper</a> in 2011.</p><p>Although the Spice Girls ultimately split following the release of their third album, Forever, in 2000, Victoria remained in the spotlight. Aside from balancing her new roles as a wife and mom, she released her first-ever solo album in 2001, as well as authored her autobiography, Learning to Fly.</p><p>It was in 2004 that she made the jump into the fashion industry. That year, she debuted a line of denim clothing called VB Rocks, followed by a collection of sunglasses in 2007, as well as her Intimately Beckham fragrance line. Nowadays, she’s the owner of Victoria Beckham clothing, which sells a large repertoire of handbags, dresses, tops, bottoms, beauty and more.</p><p>In 2018, the Spice Girls announced they were going on a <a href=#>reunion tour</a>. While&nbsp;Victoria is forever grateful for her run in the iconic group, she had a good reason for not wanting to hit the road in May 2019.</p><p>“It took me a lot of courage not to go on tour with the Spice Girls again, but to be the one who says, ‘You know, I’m not doing it because things feel different now than they used to,’” she told <a href=#>Vogue</a> Germany at the time. “I’d rather concentrate on my family and my company.”</p><p>Victoria adores fashion and her family!</p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to see the designer’s style evolution through the years.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46voJysn6e2onnBnpqkoJGieqO10a2fnZmpYsC1xcueZJ6un6HCtbXOp2RycGRlgHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
