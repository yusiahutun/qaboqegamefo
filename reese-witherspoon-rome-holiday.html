"Um...yup....pretty sure #Humpdaydoes not translate here," she captioned a photo of herself from behind holding a cup of coffee overlooking Rome. "#VacationAdventures #PostcardFromAfar @DraperJamesGirl (Have you guessed where I am yet?)."The starlet finally confirmed her location with a shot of her daughter’s gladiator sandals writing, "When in #Rome!!! @avaphillippe (OK, cat is out of the bag. We love you Italy!) #VacationAdventures #MomHumor."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3c93e5d39502-reese-witherspoon7-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e1_IPKa7jTyl data-wc=11><strong>The Hollywood star visited the Colloseum with her daughter and mother</strong></p><p id=e4jYeaFKyKuA data-wc=57>With her daughter and mother in tow, Reese played tourist visiting some of the local sites. "One of my favorite churches #StIgnatius," she wrote alongside a picture of herself in the stunning church. "Beautiful sculpture and the ceiling has the most intricate paintings. #Breathtaking! #VacationAdventures #Roma." They also later visited the famous Sistine Chapel and the Colosseum.</p><p id=e5qY-sDTdOhAa data-wc=66>Unlike most family holidays, Reese took her daughter to meet a fashion legend. "What an honor to see Mr. Valentino at dinner last night in Rome @maisonvalentino #legend," she wrote alongside a picture of the threesome. The snap also showed us once again how Reese's daughter is her splitting image. Wearing a white lace dress the teenager looked like an A-lister herself posing with the designer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0c3cb0ab0e6f-reese-witherspoon1-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eg5oY2DhJxrI data-wc=7><strong>The duo visited fashion designer Valentino's house</strong></p><p id=e4Em4z_16JPfp data-wc=40>Ava is Reese's eldest child from her first marriage to Ryan Phillippe. They also had a son Deacon together in 2003. The Wild star is now married to agent Jim Toth and they welcomed son Tennessee James Toth in 2012.</p><p id=eAlAlIRzqOsP data-wc=55>This isn't the first time we've clearly seen the resemblance between the two. Reese shared a picture before heading out to the premiere of her film Hot Pursuit in May looking just like her daughter aside from Ava's funky blue hair. "Me and my girl. Ready for #HotPursuit premiere! @avaphillippe," she captioned the Instagram picture.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfqb%2BiwsSlZmtoYWp9d36Qa2xxcGJkv6ax0p5ksKGknbKzv8%2BopqdloqS6pnnHqKOinJGufA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
