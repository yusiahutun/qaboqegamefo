The exes were seen on the red carpet, and here’s if they interacted at the Globes.</p><p>Leo and Camila first met way back in May 2017 when they both attended the Cannes Film Festival. Six months later, sources had denied rumors of their romance, but they were . In mid-December 2017 speculation about their relationship began when Leo was spotted <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>leaving Camila’s house</a>. She then spent New Year’s Eve with Leo in the affluent ski resort town of Aspen, Colorado. Just a few months later, in February 2018, they attended Ellen Degeneres’s 40th birthday party together, seemingly confirming their relationship. A source told <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>People</a>: “They are family friends and the two families are very close.” Leo placing his hand on her lower back suggests otherwise, however.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/barry-keoghan-sabrina-carpenter.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Golden-Globes-4.jpg><p>More than a year after their breakup, the two appeared on The <a href=# id=auto-tag_golden-globes data-tag=golden-globes>Golden Globes</a> red carpet. Leonardo is in attendance since he was nominated for Best Actor Performance in a Motion Picture – Drama for his role in The Killers Of The Flower Moon, while Camila starred in Daisy Jones & The Six which was nominated for Best Limited Series, Anthology Series, or Motion Picture Made for Television. However, it didn’t look like they interacted at all.</p><p>Though they didn’t run into each other, Leo opened up for a rare comment on his private life shortly before the awars. “As far as my personal life is concerned, my answer is pretty simple,” Leo told <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/07/leonardo-dicaprio-lily-gladstone-interview-mark-kermode-killers-flower-moon rel=nofollow>The Observer.</a> “I got into this industry at a very young age. I felt incredibly compelled to do this. And the irony is that I was born and raised in Hollywood. People think: ‘Oh, OK, just add water,’ right? But I tried to become an actor multiple times, and I got rejected.”</p><p>He continued, “And at 12 or 13 years old, one of those agents said: ‘OK, we’ll give you a shot.’ Since then, it’s felt like winning the lottery. And to be honest, I would have been happy doing any sort of acting jobs — commercials, television. I got the one opportunity doing&nbsp;This Boy’s Life&nbsp;with&nbsp;Robert De Niro. I watched his work, realized the caliber of actor that he was, and said to myself: ‘I will&nbsp;never&nbsp;squander this opportunity.’”</p><p>He concluded, “So since then, a lot of other stuff comes hand in hand with that. The complete loss of your private life. And you know what, a lot of people have to deal with a lot harsher things than having their private life be public knowledge. That’s just one of the byproducts. I feel too lucky to do what I do to sit here and complain about it. It’s just one of the things you have to accept, and you adapt.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=why-did-leonardo-dicaprio-and-camila-morrone-break-up>Why did Leonardo DiCaprio and Camila Morrone break up?</h2><p>A source told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">E! News</a> said they had both been “traveling a lot” and “distance played a factor.” Ultimately, the relationship “ran its course.” This echoes what another&nbsp;source told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Sun</a>, that “there are no bad feelings between [<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Leo and Camila</a>]. It just came to a natural conclusion.” That “natural conclusion,” fans have been jokingly speculating on social media, is the fact that the model turned 25 in June 2022. At 47, Leo certainly has a very particular dating pattern, so much so that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one Redditor mapped</a> out the Titanic star’s relationships over the past 20 years to show that not one girlfriend has made it much past the age of 25. Hmm.</p><p>Comedian Amy Schumer commented on this in a playful dig while hosting the Oscars in 2022, saying in her monologue: ”[Leo]’s done so much to fight climate change and leave behind a cleaner, greener planet…for his girlfriends. Because he’s older and they’re younger. OK, you get it.” Leo was actually fine with the joke when she asked him if it was OK, Schumer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">revealed to Howard Stern</a>. “He said, ‘Go ahead.’ They didn’t care,” she said, before singing Camila’s praises. “She’s actually the coolest bitch you’ll meet.”</p><p>The split is still somewhat of a shock, as sources close to the couple said they had been getting “serious” until relatively recently. Leo and Camila vacationed a lot as a couple, they had spent much of the pandemic lockdowns together, shared two huskies, and even moved in together in November 2021 when they were said to have a strong relationship. “They are really solid and everything is great with Leo and Cami,” a source told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">E! News</a> at the time. “It’s all status quo.”</p><p>In a December 2019 interview with The <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Los Angeles Times</a>, Camila made reference to her and Leo’s 23-year age gap, saying: “There’s so many relationships in Hollywood—and in the history of the world—where people have large age gaps,” she said. “I just think anyone should be able to date who they want to date.”</p><p><a href=# id=auto-tag_leonardo-dicaprio data-tag=leonardo-dicaprio>Leonardo DiCaprio</a> is reportedly dating <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/leonardo-dicaprio-vittoria-ceretti/>Vittoria Ceretti</a> while Camila is currently single.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
