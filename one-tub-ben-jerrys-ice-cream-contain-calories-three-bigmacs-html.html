decay.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The type of sugars most adults and children in the UK eat too much of are "free sugars", which includes any added to food and drink and sugars in honey, syrup and fruit juice.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But sugar found naturally in milk, fruit and vegetables do not count as free sugars.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Adults are not supposed to have more than 30g of free sugars a day - around seven sugar cubes.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Children aged seven to 10 should have no more than 24g of free sugars (six sugar cubes), while those aged four to six should not have more than 19g (five sugar cubs).</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Eating too much sugar can mean consuming too many calories, leading to weight gain.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Being overweight increases the risk of suffering heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Sugar is also one of the main causes of tooth decay.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Health chiefs advise Britons to have no more than a 150ml glass of fruit juice and smoothies per day and limit the amount of foods with high levels of free sugars.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Source: NHS</p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/health/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span

total of 1,400 calories — compared to 139 for a can of Coca-Cola.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The most sugar-filled was their Phish Food tub with 112 grams each.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And the most salt-laden was also the Salted Caramel Core at 710 milligrams.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Overall, Blue Bell's five-pint Milk Chocolate ice cream had the most calories out of any of the tubs checked by DailyMail.com — with 2,880 calories.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The most sugar-filled was also a Blue Bell — their five-pint Strawberries and Homemade Vanilla flavor which contained about 372 grams (g).</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>For comparison, one milk chocolate Hershey bar contains about 24 g of sugar.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The saltiest ice cream was Turkey Hill's three-pint Salted Caramel which had about 1,620 milligrams (mg) of sodium — far above the 260 mg in a medium helping of McDonald's fries.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Dietitian Cindel Gwyn, from Nutrition that Works, previously <a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>said</a>: 'Ice cream is a nice treat to curb cravings.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'But the downside is that overconsumption... may eventually result in weight gain, an increase in cholesterol and issues with regulating blood sugar.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Women are told to consume about 2,400 calories a day, whereas men should have about 3,000.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They should also limit themselves to about 24 grams of sugar daily, and 2,300 milligrams of salt.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Consuming over this amount leaves them at risk of obesity and the associated health risks.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The findings come amid an ongoing obesity crisis in America where the number of children and adults who are overweight continues to rise.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>To thrash out a plan to tackle the crisis President Joe Biden is to host a conference on hunger, nutrition and health this September.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The administration has already set itself the goal of ending hunger and increasing healthy eating and physical activity in the U.S. by 2030 so that fewer Americans face diet-related disease.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It is not clear what actions the administration may take, but Biden has called for 'bold' moves to help bring down American waistlines.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In 2020 Unilever — which owns Ben and Jerry's — announced it would no longer market its products to kids in an effort to curb the childhood obesity crisis.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The company said at the time: 'The World Health Organization names childhood obesity as one of the most serious public health issues of the 21st century.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'And it's a key reason why Unilever is committing to new
