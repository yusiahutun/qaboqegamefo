Nicole Polizzi unveiled her new implants for the first time in a brand new Awestruck video, where she's seen showing them off to Jenni &#34;Jwoww&#34; Farley.
&#34;I'm one week out of surgery, so they're very crazy. My nipples are like falling off,&#34; the 28-year-old mother of two says in the video below. &#34;I look like Frankenstein right now and I haven't told Jenni."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

My nipples are like falling off," the 28-year-old mother of two says in the video below. "I look like Frankenstein right now and I haven't told Jenni. I know in previous interviews I told everyone I wanted to wait to have my boobs done until after I had kids, but I could be 50 by then. I'm in my prime right now. I'm gonna be 29 and I want to be as hot as I can!"</p><p>"I call this my little mommy makeover. Being a mom, obviously your boobs are destroyed by having kids, especially breast feeding," she explains. "I want to look hot for my husband but I also want to feel great about myself and that was just an insecurity that I had."</p><p>According to Nicole, she got C implants and a lift, opting against going any bigger.</p><p>"I didn't want to have Jwoww boobs because she's the porn star and I'm just the regular cute person," she adds in the clip. "I feel so confident with myself as a woman, as a wife, as a mom. I kind of feel complete now."</p><p>Polizzi surprises Jenni with the big reveal around the 2:45 mark, after Farley fails to notice her enhanced chest.</p><p>"I got my t--s done," she finally tells her.</p><p>"Wait a minute, you actually did," Jwoww reacts. "I thought you were wearing a really good sports bra! Your boobs are fantastic."</p><p>Snooki says she's already expecting some backlash from the mommy shamers out there, but explains that now's as good a time as any for implants. "Our bodies are f--ked from having kids," she exclaims.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/4e/16by9/2016/09/12/4ecbc0194f9d55e796c4d61f12ea80a6_md.jpg width=825 height=464 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><strong>toofab's Brian Particelli</strong> spoke with Nicole about mommy shaming just last month, when she visited our studio for an interview.</p><p>"Mom shaming is really bad and it's one thing that me and Jenni hate," she said at the time. "Moms are supposed to support each other and build each other up and relate to each other. There are some moms out there who are like, 'You shouldn't do this, you shouldn't do that.' We should build each other up, not tear each other down. Everyone's going to have different parenting advice and how they do things."</p><p>Nicole experienced shaming of another kind last year, after she got lip injections. She continued her cosmetic updates in August, when she <strong><a href=#>Snapchatted her first Botox treatments</a></strong>.</p><p>"I don't even read it anymore," she said of the online trolls, "but I love posting about what I do because I'm an open book and I like people to know what I'm doing in my life. Even if they don't care, I'm still showing you," she explains. "I noticed in interviews like this, I express a lot and I noticed I had four lines and they were like permanent and I was like 'Ew, you're 28, stop it!'</p><p>What do you think of her latest procedure?
