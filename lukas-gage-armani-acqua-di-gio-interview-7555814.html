Just like many who grew up in the early aughts to the mid-2010s, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>White Lotus</a> actor and face of Giorgio Armani's latest scent <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Giorgio&nbsp;Armani&nbsp;Acqua di Gio Parfum</a> categorizes the smell of young adolescence in two ways: the sweet yet pungent smell of mall stores, and Axe body spray.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I would steal my older brothers' and try on their collections of colognes. As a little kid, I was really into it and I always wanted to find my scent," Gage tells InStyle over Zoom. "But the earliest memories I have [of that] are not the best; I just was very limited on the colognes and stuff. I would do Axe body spray when I was a little kid, and I worked at Banana Republic [which] just was flooded with the insane aromas in the aisle that we had to spritz down every couple hours."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Giorgio Armani Beauty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's safe to say that his taste has become a bit more elevated these days. While he likes to change up his scent, he says he normally gravitates toward lighter smells that remind him of the beach. Originally from San Diego, California, he loves a scent like the new Acqua Di Gio to bring him a piece of home while he's away. "It actually brings me back to being on a happy day on the beach," he says. "So if I'm not close to the beach, I need that scent to bring me back to that time."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Combining notes of bergamot, rosemary, and incense, Acqua Di Gio is soothing and fresh. Its ingredients are also sustainably sourced and it comes in a refillable bottle, furthering the brand's mission to create more products that are better for the environment. To celebrate the launch, the beauty brand tapped Gage along with actors <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Chase Stokes</a>, Jonathan Daviss, and Michael Evans Behling to star in its latest campaign. Gage says one of the best parts of this new partnership with Armani is walking away in a new bromance with his fellow campaign stars.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I talk to all three of them weekly," he says. "I just had a birthday and my friends all got these videos of people putting [out] a message about why they love me and all three of them were in the video. We've come from different places, but we all really created this beautiful friendship with each other and just are taking a little time off to enjoy the beauty of the beach together [while shooting the campaign], I think it was a really cool moment."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Giorgio Armani Beauty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for best grooming and skin advice he's ever received, he has two tips that he lives by: always use sunscreen, and spritz a bit of fragrance in your hair — but only a bit, as many have alcohol and you don't want to damage any strands. "Everyone likes good-smelling hair and you never know [who you might meet or run into]," he says. "I just love having my hair smell good and having just a little tiny bit in your hair."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And Gage would know about impromptu meetings: His IMDB page is filling up, fast. Next for Gage includes starring in Road House with Jake Gyllenhaal in 2024 and the new DC universe show Dead Boy Detectives on Netflix. He'll also star in season five of Fargo. But even with all the exciting projects down the line, he says he's learned to enjoy every moment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If we're not having fun and we're not taking a moment to take a break and step away, then that's not living life," he says. "You need those moments."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y66imqtdnK6osYyaqaaZnp56oq%2FQrphmnJlitKq7jKKlrZ2iq7amw4xwbG5taGaB</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
