While she calmly stepped out of them, as captured in Bravo's video, she then bent down to try and grab them and that's when the whole escalator stopped, holding tight to those heels.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> called the moment "iconic" on Bravo's Instagram share of the moment, while <a href=#><strong>Erika Jayne</strong></a> called Brynn a "LEGEND ðŸ‘ ðŸ‘  ðŸ˜‚."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>As everyone started laughing, Brynn made her way to the panel sans shoes. "It looks like The Wizard of Oz," she laughed at the image of her shoes being held tight by the stalled escalator, toes pointing skyward. "Do I have to pay for the escalator?" she asked.</p><p>When Andy came out for the panel, he again called the moment "iconic," quipping, "Is there a dead person under it?" He then said that this is "the photo of BravoCon."</p><p>TooFab caught up with Brynn later where we couldn't resist asking her about "one of the biggest moments" of BravoCon -- perhaps even, to borrow from Andy, the most "iconic!"</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/85/16by9/2023/11/05/850012c90f7244d292cc54f9eac967d2_md.jpg width=825 height=464 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=visually-hidden>Play video content</span><p>"I almost died, it was so funny," Brynn laughed. "I was just mortified. I had to do the whole panel barefoot."</p><p>While she did retrieve the shoes and put them back on to take photos on the red carpet backstage, she had to take them off midway through the press line because she realized they had bent and were simply not wearable. She did the rest of the interviews sans shoes.</p><p>She then quickly turned it into a life lesson, albeit one with a very specific audience. "My grammy used to say, always wear clean underwear," she told TooFab. "Always have a pedicure at BravoCon in case your Louboutins get stuck in the escalator!"</p><p>Brynn might just be the breakout star of the rebooted RHONY cast, quickly gaining fans. She shared a sweet fan encounter with TooFab, while also proudly displaying all the fan bracelets she'd picked up to that point at BravoCon.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:d2deb06e-3c9b-418f-b6da-12b619f27e19 data-container-ref=toofab:article:afa1e989-a121-432a-81ef-181b99083de9 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/30/5by4/2023/11/05/30224a7b4774488bbee6424ad25e51bd_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kyle Richards Uses Word 'Divorce' While Addressing Mauricio Umansky Situation at BravoCon (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"A fan came up to me and brought a Purdue University pin, and that's my alma mater and it was just the nicest thing in the whole world," she said. "Never did I think my undergraduate degree would lead me here but, look at me now!"</p><p>We also asked her about being single on the show and whether that led to any spicy DMs from guys watching, and she confirmed that "dudes love it," referring to the show. But, she lamented, "Nobody wanted to film with me last year."</p><p>"I think now seeing it, understanding it, I think people now might be more open to filming," she added. "We need someone to film with, you know?"</p><p>The Real Housewives of New York City wrapped its 14th season just last month.</p><a id=gallery-link-73945b91-7afe-475c-8e39-4cc213d89c81 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:73945b91-7afe-475c-8e39-4cc213d89c81 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:afa1e989-a121-432a-81ef-181b99083de9 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e8/4by3/2023/11/04/e863ab687a314901b2f338e1f8002189_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGpmaW1fp7Wwuthmqq2ZomKvs8XNp2SwoJmps6qxy51kpaejmsButMSeo6xllaiworjAraarZZKnrre7wqilaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
