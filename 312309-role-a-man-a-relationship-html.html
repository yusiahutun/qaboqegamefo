Here are the responsibilities.</p><h3>1. Taking responsibility</h3><p class=align-left>As the managers of households, men will and should always take responsibility for their actions and the people around them. It is all about finding the appropriate ways of responsibly handling challenging situations.</p><p class=align-left>Some of such situations are usually tricky hence require an equal measure of wisdom and making confident decisions.</p><p class=align-left>For instance, when it comes to discussing a serious topic in a relationship, a man should take the lead role in steering the conversation towards a logical conclusion while allowing inputs from others.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: 10 signs you're dating an immature boyfriend</p><h3>2.

For a successful relationship, you would want your man of the house to have a clear vision. Let not the relationship be blinded and based on love alone.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9b4802e451c27a66.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best motivational speeches for students</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Visionary men will give you the space to grow as a woman hence laying a good foundation for a mature relationship for the long haul. Without any vision, expect nothing more than mediocrity.</p><h3>3. Showing and giving support</h3><p class=align-left>Off the top of your head, having a supportive husband or partner is probably the most common manly duties in a relationship a man should deliver. In this case, support is not about regular activities like cleaning and doing shopping for the household. A supportive man is one who’ll support your life’s aspirations and dreams.</p><p class=align-left>Such a man will put measures in place so that you’ll be able to grow as a woman, grow in your career, and achieve your dreams. It would be miserable to be in a relationship with an unsupportive boyfriend or husband.</p><h3>4. Should be loving</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5e9a72581876625a.jpg><p class=align-left>Another important role of a man in a relationship is to know how to love right. The man will always go out of his way to show his love for his woman. He’ll lead the way in helping both of you learn the love language to each other. After both of you are on the same page, your relationship will be more than just showing love, it will transcend to your intimate life.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhsufb6oimmqio.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 motivational Jack Ma quotes you can learn from</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The love will drip down to your sexual life.

Into commitments</h3><p class=align-left>From a relationship standpoint, a man should commit to a woman to set a good precedent for a stable companionship. With time, such a setup will also lead to trust and faithfulness. These two virtues should be both ways for the relationship to work.</p><h3>6. Show leadership</h3><p class=align-left>This role closely ties to taking responsibility, which is highlighted above. The man should always step forward and handle the situation at hand. Boys who are yet to be men tend to shy away from such roles because they are afraid of getting criticized in case they mess up.</p><h3>7. Strong and decisive</h3><p class=align-left>Find yourself a man who is decisive and can stand by their beliefs. Such a man already knows what they want in life and are very prompt in deciding what will benefit their families.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs1htuvm7ie528.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Quotes about change in life</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In tricky situations, a man will remain strong, calm, and measured.

Anyway, it’s good to remember that relationships are also about the roles that both partners play. Partners who have managed to find the common ground in their companionship tend to deal with issues with little or no much fuss.</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>How to win over a girl who rejected you</strong></li><li><strong>7 tips for dating without a car to avoid turning off women</strong></li><li><strong>Signs your girlfriend is lesbian or bisexual</strong></li><li><strong>How to reject a girl politely without hurting her feelings</strong></li><li><strong>How to tell if your baby mama still loves you</strong></li></ul><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2FkGtqaXFdp7ytsYyaZKaZnmKubr7EpZitoZ%2BjwKm1z2efraWc</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
