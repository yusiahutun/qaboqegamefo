It's one thing for the books to already be finished, but when the movies come to a close, it feels as if the <a href=# class=T3D>beloved series is really finally over</a>. I don't want to let go! In fact, in order to immortalize my love, I've even been considering <a href=# class=T3D>getting a <i>Hunger Games</i> tattoo in honor</a> of the series.</p><p>While the Mockingjay symbol is the most powerful image most people associate with the series, the books are also filled with impactful quotes that would make for beautiful and practical tattoos. (I think<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D> Cressida's ivy tattoo</a> that winds up her face is amazing ... but I don't think I'm brave enough to tattoo my face. And while Cinna is my favorite character, I could never permanently tattoo golden eyeliner to my eyelids.)</p><p>Fortunately, there are many other tattoo options that are <a href=# class=T3D>inspired by <i>The Hunger Games</i> </a>that aren't directly attached to the characters' appearances. I've gathered a list of some unique tattoos you just might fall in love with and need to get before the last movie comes out.</p><p>Is this amazing list real or not real?</p><p>Real.</p><h3>Rue's Whistle</h3><p>The four note song that has practically become iconic makes for an adorable and meaningful tattoo. This one is for all the music and Rue lovers out there.</p><h3>Stay Alive</h3><p>Haymitch, though he's a drunk and unstable at times, is still one of my favorite characters. This tattoo of the little parachute paired with Haymitch's wise advice is perfect.</p><h3>As Radiant As The Sun</h3><p>Katniss Everdeen is full of strong quotes, and this one will be an amazing motivational tattoo, if that's what you're after. Remembering you're as radiant as the sun should definitely keep you up and going when times get rough.</p><h3>Primrose</h3><p>Primrose, the adorable little duck we all love and adore. Getting a tattoo of the flower she's named after seems like a pretty unique and beautiful way to show your love for her.</p><h3>Dandelions</h3>"What I need is the dandelion in the spring. The bright yellow that means rebirth instead of destruction. The promise that life can go on, no matter how bad our losses. That it can be good again. And only Peeta can give me that." — Katniss Everdeen, <i>Mockingjay</i><p>Easily one of the most romantic quotes in the series, these dandelions represent the possibility of rebirth after a traumatic past.</p><h3>I Have Plenty Of Fire Within Myself</h3><p>Another Katniss Everdeen motivator, and one that would look gorgeous just about anywhere on you.</p><h3>Tick Tock</h3><p>If you're like me and <i>Catching Fire</i> was your favorite book of the series, then a tattoo dedicated to the outrageously intricate arena might be a great tattoo for you.</p><h3>Hope Is The Only Thing Stronger Than Fear</h3><p>I love that this quote is surrounded by two arrows, but it also leaves a lot of room for creativity. You could add a Mockingjay symbol, a bow, or a personal image that means something to you.</p><h3>Always</h3><p>The dandelion theme is brought back into this tattoo and is joined by birds. While "always" has a few different meanings for every book-nerd, the word will <i>always</i> make a great tattoo.</p><h3>Real</h3><p>Is this cute tattoo real or not real? Definitely real.</p><h3>The Mockingjay Symbols</h3><p>You can't go wrong with the three symbols that made up each book. This design is simple and easy — for the true superfan.</p><p>Images: <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Kendra Miller</a>/<i>flickr; giphy (1)</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyfZNybm5lYWZ6trrIqqyeZZiqu6ix0WaemqWVqHq1rdOtpqirXam1osCMmqmeZZSas6q6yK2cpbFdp7KiuA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
