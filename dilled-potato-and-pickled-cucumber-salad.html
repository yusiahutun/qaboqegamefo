Looking for something to bring to a backyard barbeque a few summers ago–in those funny days before I knew which part of the kitchen counter to rest my sunglasses on when I came in and before my mother-in-law began casually passing me salads and asking if I could dress them so she could move onto her next dish– I knew this was it by the fact that Epicurious testers had ranked this one within the top three most worthy of their Fork Ratings. (On a site with hundreds of potato salad recipes, that ain’t nothing.) In addition seemed to have all the magical elements present in so many other <a href=#><i>zakuski</i></a>–dill, radishes, something, <i>anything</i> brined, onions and potato, though they’re practically an afterthought in this great mass of ingredients–I knew it would not be tossed aside lightly.</p><p><a href=# title="ready to assemble"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/c1.staticflickr.com/5/4206/34280765054_1a293a5861_z.jpg width=640 height=427 alt="ready to assemble" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a href=# title="mix everything but dressing"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/c1.staticflickr.com/5/4263/34315231653_e32640a1ef_z.jpg width=640 height=427 alt="mix everything but dressing" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Of course I was appalled that it was a two-day affair–“It expects me to MAKE pickles, Alex! Is this recipe insane?!” Now, as we well know, <a href=#>I barely bat an eyelash at this step anymore</a>, but you shouldn’t either because it’s really not time-consuming, and if you make extra, as we always do, you’ll love their lightly-soused crunch in your salads all week. From the pickling on out, it’s cinch city and I promise, even if you’re not trying to win yourself a Russian For Life, it could make a potato salad lover out of you. There are worse things, right?</p><p><a href=# title="dilled potato and pickled cucumber salad"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/c1.staticflickr.com/5/4215/34280762584_dc280a94d2_z.jpg width=640 height=427 alt="dilled potato and pickled cucumber salad" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a href=# title="dilled potato and pickled cucumber salad"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/c1.staticflickr.com/5/4276/34315231193_40bd38f199_z.jpg width=640 height=426 alt="dilled potato and pickled cucumber salad" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><h3 class="p-name jetpack-recipe-title fn" itemprop=name>Dilled Potato and Pickled Cucumber Salad</h3><ul class=jetpack-recipe-meta><li class="jetpack-recipe-servings p-yield yield" itemprop=recipeYield><strong>Servings: </strong>8, or more as part of a spread</li><li class=jetpack-recipe-time><strong>Time:</strong> <span class=time>45 minutes, plus an overnight rest</span></li><li class=jetpack-recipe-source><strong>Source: </strong><a href=#>Bon Appetit, August 2004</a></li><li class=jetpack-recipe-print><a href=#>Print</a></li></ul><br><b>This recipe was refreshed and slightly streamlined, with new photos added, in June 2017.</b><p>One of our favorite things about this salad is that it is as much vegetables — crunchy, delicious ones, half of which are lightly pickled — as it is potatoes, so it feels like something you might eat with dinner in warmer weather, and not only as a grilling side dish.</p><p>My preference is to assemble potato salads just an hour or two before eating it, so I mix everything and keep the mayo separate until needed. I actually found upon revisiting this recipe that I only needed <i>half</i> the mayo amount to get the salad as dressed as I want it (as dressed as you see here) but as this recipe has been on the site for 10 years and few have complained, I’m leaving it as written.</p><p>This makes a lot of salad.

Add cucumbers and dill branches; turn several times to coat with mixture. Refrigerate overnight. If and when you pop into the fridge, turn the bag to keep things well mixed.<p><b>Cook your potatoes:</b> Although you don’t have to, I also like to boil my potatoes the day before, because I like them very cold, and it seems easier to get it out of the way. Boil them in a large pot salted water until tender, about 30 minutes. Drain, then cool completely. I leave them in the fridge overnight.</p><p><b>The next day:</b> Drain cucumber mixture in a colander; if you’ve got an hour, you can drain it that long, but I never do. Discard brine and dill.</p><p><b>Assemble your salad:</b> The original directions called for peeling your cold potatoes but I never do. Cut potatoes crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Place potatoes in large bowl; sprinkle generously with coarse salt and pepper. Add drained cucumbers, onion, sliced radishes, and remaining 3 tablespoons dill; toss to blend.</p><p><b>1 to 2 hours before serving:</b> Stir mayonnaise into salad to taste. Season with additional salt and pepper. Serve cold or at room temperature.</p><p><b>Do ahead:</b> Salad keeps dressed for a day. Salad keeps without mayo for a few days; I add mayo before serving. In both cases, keep it covered in the fridge.</p><br><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-250 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-250 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
