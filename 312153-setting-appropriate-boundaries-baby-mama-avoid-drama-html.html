Frequent telephone calls.</h3><p class=align-left>If your baby mama calls your phone regularly seeking to talk over petty things, then this is a sign that you have to deal with baby mama drama immediately. She might be entitled to call you to fill you in over the affairs of your child. However, contacting you over issues such as her personal life or seeking too much advice means that it is time you sort the situation out.</p><h3>2. Unreasonable demands.</h3><p class=align-left>As part of the baby daddy's separation with your ex-girl, you may have come to an understanding of issues such as alimony, child support, and custody sharing. However, along the way, she may be tempted to change the arrangements in ways that may not favor you like inflating the money or limiting you from accessing your child. Alternatively, the baby mama may try to limit your child from visiting your new home with your newly found flame. All these are clear indications of unhealthy boundaries with ex wife, and you need to address the issue immediately.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/79fef1a2cb93b996.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ Zulu proverbs and sayings about love, life, and death</span></p></a><h3>3. Regular conflict.</h3><p class=align-left>This may affect both the baby daddy and the new love. If your guy's ex-wife is always seeking to create a rift between you and your guy, you have baby mama trouble. Such ladies mostly take advantage of the co-parenting communication in place to whisper terrible stuff to his hear. All these signs are not good for anyone, whether you are the daddy or the new girl in town. Thus, they need immediate attention.</p><h3>4. Unexplained presence in his life.</h3><p class=align-left>At times, your ex-wife may realize how much you were a gem after you have separated. After all, don't they say that you never know what you got until it is gone? If she wants to be constantly present in your life or that of your boyfriend now that they are separated, then there could be some baby daddy problems to be addressed.</p><h2>Getting to understand the problem</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/84775da1306559b8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 subtle signs of relationship abuse and what you should do</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It is essential to understand what the source of your woes is before finding a possible solution to your problem. You may end up fixing a non-existent problem or temporarily fixing an issue if you fail to understand their origin. First, you may have failed to establish proper channels and boundaries of communication with your baby mama. This causes confusion, which may lead to disagreements as one party may feel shortchanged if their concern is not heard.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9d981039f402a0da.jpg><p class=align-left>Bitter feelings over either how the initial relationship was or came to an end could also lead to this problem. Although she may be flaunting her new sweetheart on social media, chances are she still holds grudges from the past relationship. This feeling may cause your baby mama to try sabotaging your new relationship for revenge.</p><p class=align-left>Also, she may feel shortchanged by you to bear the burden of raising the child alone. Simply being responsible for a kid on weekends or during day time may not compare with being responsible for the kid for other periods. The party responsible for the latter may feel the former dumped the responsibilities with them and left to pursue someone else to start a new life with them.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d5def4a9bdc0e35b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>I love you mom quotes and messages from daughter and son</span></p></a><h2>Solutions for coping with a difficult baby mama.</h2><p class=align-left>If you want your relationships to thrive, it is vital to find the right balance between your past and the present. Much of the burden often falls with you, the man, to draw a viable boundary. Not only does the stability of your child's mother depend on it, but also the happiness of your newly found love. Here are four solutions that may help you deal with baby mama drama.</p><h3>1. Ensure your new catch understands and respects your relationship with your ex-wife.</h3><p class=align-left>Whether the two of you want it or not, your baby mama is still an integral part of your lives. So it is imperative you find the right place for her lest you will have to deal with spite. You do not have to let her have a room in your new home, but simply leaving room for her in your lives and looking after your baby should suffice. Before taking things to a new level with your new catch, inform her of your predicament and try to listen and understand her point of view then adjust accordingly.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1f7dcb04e23e54cb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>110+ best blessed with a baby girl status for FB, Instagram, WhatsApp</span></p></a><h3>2. Have a clear agreement of your roles as parents even if you are separated.</h3><p class=align-left>If a written agreement is not in place outlining your arrangement over critical issues, it may be a good time to obtain one now. But, does the baby mama always win? A notarized, written down arrangement should help each party understand their responsibilities and obligations; hence, avoids misunderstandings. Knowing when visitations are due and the method to be followed helps everyone play their part. Additionally, amending written down terms is often a process; hence, limits irrational decisions.</p><h3>3. Break from ugly traditions and bad habits</h3><p class=align-left>Once another lady comes into the picture, you may need a few adjustments to ensure that you take into account her presence. Her presence means that you have to consider both your baby mama and your kid as well as your newly found love. Certain things you did before, such as frequently visiting your ex while single and some traditions from your first marriage such as having family game nights the entire weekend have to stop or be controlled. Always maintain a cordial relationship with your former wife, but remember, you have someone else now.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cf339000f4853033.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to stop loving the father of your child as a single mom</span></p></a><h3>4. Know the lanes.</h3><p class=align-left>It is vital to establish order now that there are many people involved in your life by creating realistic lanes. These boundaries are particularly important at the beginning as people try to adjust. Once the adjustments are complete, following the put restrictions will be easier, and many problems will be avoided. Boundaries should be established on issues such as calls, texts, respect, and your child's life. Though you may later change all these accordingly, they will help you in your new way of life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/79fef1a2cb93b996.jpg><p class=align-left>Are you having trouble setting appropriate boundaries with baby mama?
