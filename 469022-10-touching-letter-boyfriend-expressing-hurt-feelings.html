Nevertheless, it would be beneficial if you were courageous enough to express your emotions. Here are some ideas to get you started:</p>My darling, I've discovered that writing down my thoughts is sometimes preferable to striving to express my feelings aloud. Besides, we're both aware that emotions can blur everything. I'm already dealing with hurt feelings and outbursts of rage. I'd rather not put my foot in my mouth and be unable to retract something I regret speaking.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a91f9eb679982aa3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ sweet quotes about liking a boy straight from your heart</span></p></a>Sweetheart, you have no idea how much it hurt me, but I don't want to feel this way any longer. Please assist me in comprehending what occurred so we can put it behind us and move on. I require closure. I'd like to know where you stand on this and how it will affect us in the future. I haven't changed my thoughts about our relationship, but I'm desperate for clarification.<h2>A letter for a boyfriend who hurt you</h2><p class=align-left>To heal hurting wounds and stories, note them down, leave them reflected on paper, and bid farewell to all the negative emotions that your boyfriend induced you. Here are some examples:</p>Darling, I understand we haven't spoken in a few days, and I apologise for not returning your calls; I just can't even face you right now. We've known each other for a long time and shared many happy memories. I thought I was past being upset, but I'm not quite there yet. But it bothers me that you would request my housemate out right away. We've been hooking up for quite some time, and I couldn't help but feel betrayed.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/633484a949388e53.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ long texts to send your boyfriend to make him feel special</span></p></a>Sweetheart, I could begin this letter in various ways, hurling gestures and acts in your direction. But that's not how I want to begin. So, instead, I'm going to rewrite the entire story and appreciate you. I can't begin this piece any other way. I will be forever grateful to you, even though it took me a long time to realise it. It took time and many reflections, nights without sleep, weeping and thinking to reach a clear conclusion, which I now have. No one told me we had to peruse our story from beginning to end, rather than the other way around. As a result, regardless of how hard I tried, I couldn't grasp anything until it was all over.<h2>Letter to your boyfriend about feeling unwanted</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/acc44e59a8465bcf.png><p class=align-left>Sometimes it's just necessary to learn how to express <a href=#>hurt feelings</a> in words to confront the truth. That is why you should write a letter to your boyfriend about your feelings of being unwanted. Here are good examples:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c47f8a3ed8840892.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>40+ long paragraphs for your crush to express your feelings</span></p></a>Honey, this letter is my yell for your attention, finally putting my pain into words because I'm sick of leaving things unsaid. I've never informed you how chilly it feels when you stare at me like I'm a ghost. You don't appear to enjoy being near me any longer. We make the real drama rather than cuddling and watching a film together. We yell at each other while pretending that we're yelling about something insignificant. We're two individuals who pledged each other eternity and have been partners for years. Unfortunately, that's not how you measure eternity, and I'd like to know that I can rely on eternal life with you.My love, do you have any idea how you make me feel? I've told you several times. I've cried, begged, and screamed for you to listen. It makes no difference. Perhaps because I keep supporting you even when you do not reciprocate, I suppose it was my fault. I am always more concerned than others. I am always more generous than others. I push myself to the level of exhaustion, frustration, and anxiety, and all I ask in return is that someone listens to me now and then. I wish it had been you. I have faith in you. I'll tell you my secrets. I'm open and honest with you. Perhaps it bothers me so much that you can't reciprocate.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/86e8c2d29033047c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ emotional quotes when someone hurts you deeply in a relationship</span></p></a><h2>Letter to someone you love who hurt you</h2><p class=align-left>When attempting to express hurt feelings in person, you may find it difficult to get your point across if your emotions are extremely high. Rather, writing it all down enables you to communicate all of your <a href=#>painful thoughts</a> effectively. Consider the examples below:</p>Dear love, I was your pal. I was part of your family. I used to be your lover. You are a person who could have been many things to me. Heartbreak makes no distinction when it comes to people who let you down. I've always believed in you. I believed you and the promises you made to me. I believed in your goals and ignored your ambiguity. I let you in despite my better judgement. I never stopped defending you. I saw the lovely aspects of who you were. I made plans with you and stored them in my mind as if they were an assured magnificent destination. I adored you. I gave you everything I had, but now I feel empty and deceived. But do you know what the oddest and most irritating aspect of this is? I pardon you.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/68913f3a252a8247.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Quotes to say when someone dies unexpectedly: 50+ sad and emotional sayings</span></p></a>My sweetheart, I'd like to write to you to let you know that you have disappointed me. I might write the phrases repeatedly, but it would make no difference. I might yell it at the pinnacle of my lungs and tell the world how much you've hurt me, but the past will not hear or care. I could despise you. I could bury my enmity for you deep within myself and protect it as a remembrance of the pain you caused me. But I am the only person aware of its existence, allowing it to nibble away at my heart, so why establish it?<h2>Letter about letting go of someone you love but hurts you</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a91f9eb679982aa3.jpg><p class=align-left>Sometimes it is difficult to let go of the person you love because you don't know what will transpire afterwards.

I want to let you go. But I don't want to stop thinking about you. I'm afraid I won't miss you anymore. It hurts to be missing you. I want this agony to end. But if I let the pain go, you'll be gone. I know that once I leave, what we were will no longer exist; like an old stone engraved in the ground, you will become history. I'm just not ready to burn your memory down just yet.Darling, I can't just sit across from you and speculate about your life. I'm curious who you think of when you first wake up. To my surprise, you might drop the name of a guy. I'm curious who is behind that new smile I don't recognise. So I'm the gatekeeper. I'm attempting to safeguard my memory of us because I'm not yet strong enough to let you go. I know our love story is going up in flames while time slowly dusts off the bond of love within us. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/73434aeaad3f804f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Romantic love messages and pictures</span></p></a><p class=align-left>What other option do you have besides writing a touching letter to your boyfriend expressing your hurt feelings?
