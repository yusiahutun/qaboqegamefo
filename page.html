It started when I bookmarked it nearly three years ago. Three! Each and every summer, it has managed to get lost in the shuffle of tomato season. This summer I decided it would be made <i>no matter what</i> only to discover that the link I had to the recipe no longer worked and that — huh? — I apparently didn’t own or couldn’t find <a href=#>the cookbook it came from</a>. Amazon fixed that a week later, and I set to making it for a barbecue last weekend, only for the barbecue plans to fall through as heirloom tomatoes grew soft on our counter. One thing after another got in the way of this salad this week — first we were out of buttermilk, then basil, then daylight, then energy… — until I finally dug my heels in last night and decided that we would have corn bread salad with dinner <i>or else</i>. I know, I’m so intimidating when I threaten salad.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=500 height=332 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2015/05/granola-bars1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> Some of you have asked me to share what kind of cooking I’ve been doing to stash in the freezer and hopefully tide us over for the coming storm (T-minus 22 days, not that anyone is counting). I know it’s common, in a fit of impatient nesting, for soon-to-be mamas to tuck away pans of enchiladas and lasagnas and meatballs and other hearty, freezable fare so that they don’t starve in those early weeks when the baby demands constant surveillance (okay, cooing), but despite understanding the logic behind this, I should confess: I’m prepping nothing.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=500 height=332 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2015/05/nectarine-galette1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> Has it really been nearly two years we talked about the <a href=#>Simplest Apple Tart</a>? What a bummer, I say, a darn shame because there’s no reason to limit this pared-down approach to fruit desserts to apple season. Stone fruits are a natural match for this type of open, single crust tart — they bake up gorgeously, don’t lose so much liquid that you end up flooding the crust (or your oven floor) and oh, they’re all so flawless right now that even nectarines, which unfairly play second fiddle to peaches, deserve their own day in the spotlight.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=2440 height=1622 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2009/08/tomato-and-corn-pie.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> Let me tell you about something that <i>always</i> happens, and it’s the best thing, ever: A month or so ago, a reader emailed me and asked me if I’d ever tried a tomato pie. No, not the Italian-American tomato pie seen in New York and New Jersey — a thick, bready pizza dough slathered with sauce and broiled with Romano cheese on top then served in squares — but a Southern thing, baked in a pie shell. Where I’m from, “tomato pie” is the Italian-ish thing I’ve described it above, thus I responded that I’ve never heard of it before and added “but mark my words, not two days after I send off this email, I will have heard about it three times.”<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=500 height=333 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2015/05/cubed-hacked-caprese1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> When it comes to off-the-cuff and mostly unplanned cooking, I have a tendency to do this thing that, depending on your perspective, is either a total shame or completely understandable: I don’t tell you about it. I’ll have thrown together a salad or a sandwich or some odd assortment of vegetables and couscous and made us lunch or dinner and Alex will say, “will you put this on your site?” and I’ll say “Of course not. Is there some shortage of recipes for sandwiches or roasted vegetables on the internet? Feh, it would be <i>totally boring content</i>.” [Yes, I actually talk like this. It’s embarrassing and I should keep to myself.]<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=2048 height=1365 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2009/08/49536963062_1d207ce605_k.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Tips</span></a><p>There are few baked goods and/or <a href=#>frostings</a> not improved by the addition of brown sugar but if your kitchen is anything like mine — that is, woefully understocked most of the time — you’ve probably needed it before and not had it. Fortunately, you can make your own with a combination of molasses and regular sugar. To make one cup of <b>light brown sugar</b>, combine 1 cup granulated sugar with 1 1/2 tablespoons molasses; to make one cup of <b>dark brown sugar</b>, combine 1 cup granulated sugar with 1/4 cup molasses; the food processor works great for this, if you have one. Now bring on those <a href=#>brown sugar shorties</a>!</p><p>Does your grocery store have the nerve to inconsistently stock cake flour? Does it drive you crazy to see recipe after recipe that calls for it, and wonder what else you can use? Good news: Cake flour is really easy to make at home. Add two tablespoons of corn starch to each cup of regular flour and sift this mixture together twice. Measure your cups of flour from this mixture.</p><p>So you’ve made some <a href=#>fruit scones</a> or <a href=#>peach cupcakes</a> and you notice that the end product is streaked blue and green. Sound familiar? In almost every case, it’s not you, it’s your baking powder. Baking powder with aluminum in it reacts to acidic ingredients, causing this discoloration and what many people find to be a “tinny” or metallic taste. Fortunately, this is as easy to rectify as ditching your baking powder for an aluminum-free brand, such as <a href=#>Rumford</a> (the brand also makes <a href=#>Clabber Girl</a> baking powder, which, oddly, <i>does</i> contain aluminum) or <a href=#>Bob’s Red Mill</a>.</p><p>The biggest different between all-purpose and bread flour is the amount of gluten: bread flour has more of it. But it may seem annoying to have to keep a giant bag of bread flour around if you’re only an occasional bread-baker. Enter a product known as a “<a href=#>gluten additive</a>” or gluten flour, something you can usually add one tablespoon of to each cup of all-purpose flour to turn it into bread flour. Think of all the cabinet space you’ll save!</p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=2048 height=1364 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2009/08/46753830855_88da930e4c_k.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Tips</span></a><p>If I could <a href=#>ice every cake</a> in <a href=#>whipped cream</a>, I would. But, because it is whipped with air alone, it doesn’t stay thick over many hours. One way to keep it stable is to dissolve 1 teaspoon of gelatin in 2 tablespoons of boiling water, cool it to room temperature and drizzle it into your whipping cream when it is halfway thickened. Then, whip it a little longer than usual — until it holds medium-firm peaks.</p><p><strong>Updated in 2019:</strong> I’ve been remiss to add the simpler stabilization method I’ve used for the last several years. It’s adapted from <a href=#>Nancy Silverton</a> and it never fails. For every cup of heavy cream you whip, beat in 1 to 2 tablespoons of sour cream or creme fraiche. It won’t make it tangy (or not in any truly notable way) but it does keep the whipped cream stable. I have had jars of this in the fridge for 4 to 5 days and found them just as fluffy as they were on the first day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirnZ7BtbHNpKCtm5iau2%2BvzqZmqZmXmnx5hY54nZubnJ6xfpygepiTn3mBf7Wfzm1%2FbZ%2BGnK%2Byv8yDjqKkk5m%2FmcHQi2qnrnZ%2BtqKit6eDpHx%2BoKOVha2TmWuriqDCpoS%2Bmpyml3GKmZKypKp%2FsHyjgYG4xa2oj6iOcYjDsZCnjG%2BBmqanmY%2B%2FsYChhalxqqWnoLF6ZH2IfZuOepOwnYiCh5KioYa504I%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
