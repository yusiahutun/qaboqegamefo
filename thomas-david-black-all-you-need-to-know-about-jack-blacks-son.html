Keep reading to learn more about him and his family.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/jackson-jack-black-1024x768-fotor-20231026141131.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Many_Kids_Does_Jack_Black_Have></span>How Many Kids Does Jack Black Have?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jack Black may have acted out dozens of hit movies and portrayed many beloved characters. However, his favorite role has nothing to do with his job as an actor and more to do with his family.</p><p>Jack Black and his wife, Tanya Haden, have been blessed with two kids so far. Their first child was named Samuel Jason Black, and he was born in June 2006.&nbsp;</p><p>His brother, Thomas David Black, arrived in 2008 and was named after his father, who was named Thomas Jacob Black at birth. Like his dad, Samuel is passionate about the entertainment business. Jack Black once gushed about the boy’s interest in filmmaking.&nbsp;</p><p>He said: “Sammy, my 15-year-old, gets a kick out of some of my stories that I tell him about Hollywood adventures. He was like, ‘Hey, can I make a movie about some of your Hollywood adventures? But I won’t say that it’s you. I’m like, ‘You bet. You go. Run with it, my son. My stories are your stories. That is what I can bestow upon you.'”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Thomas_David_Black_Jack_Blacks_Second_Son></span>Who Is Thomas David Black, Jack Black’s Second Son?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Thomas David Black is Jack’s second son and is interested in showbiz like his older brother. He reportedly enjoys the art of filmmaking and is interested in production as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Already, he has been gathering experience thanks to his father. Jack launched a YouTube channel in 2018, and both Thomas and Samuel often make appearances, edit, and serve as videographers of his gaming videos.&nbsp;</p><p>Jack said about them in 2019: “They’ve been super creative lately. They both have made cool little short films on their iPhones. I [am] so proud and grateful for my family.”</p><p>There is little doubt that Thomas has taken an interest in the entertainment world. However, that’s not all he is passionate about.&nbsp;</p><p>During a May 2015 appearance on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” his father revealed that Thomas liked martial arts. The actor claimed that he and the young boy often practiced martial arts together and even showed Fallon a photo that captured Thomas doing a fighting stance.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Old_Is_Thomas_David_Black></span>How Old Is Thomas David Black?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Thomas David Black was born on May 23, 2008, which makes him 15 years old as of 2023.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jack_Black_on_Parenthood></span>Jack Black on Parenthood<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He is one of Hollywood’s most sought-after comedy actors with a long list of credits under his belt, but he does not joke about spending time with Thomas and his brother.&nbsp;</p><p>He once <a href=#>said</a>: “I love just hanging poolside with the boys, with [Tanya] and the boys. A day by the pool, that’s a nice day off.”</p><p>Jack has also provided important parenting advice in the past. In April 2022, he said:&nbsp;</p><p>“Listen. Listen to your kids. There’s a lot of importance put on giving the right advice. But dude, even more important is just listening because that’s so important for their communication skills, to know that someone’s listening and for them to get the practice to form ideas.”</p>Jack Black.<p>The “Kung Fu Panda” star shares a tight bond with his boys, but he has also confessed that he is still susceptible to embarrassing dad moments that leave them cautioning him. In September 2018, Jack said: “I’m the dorky dad my boys are humiliated by. They’re always like, ‘Shut up, Dad. You’re so dumb.”</p><p>He tries his best to make sure he does not fall short of their grace and has been working hard to make sure they keep seeing him as not just their father but also their friend.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Thomas_David_Blacks_Parents></span>Thomas David Black’s Parents<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=#>Jack Black</a> and Tanya met as students of Crossroads School, but nothing happened between them until much later.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/blck.jpg><p>The pair parted ways following graduation but reconnected about 15 years later at one of their friend’s birthdays. They immediately hit it off and started dating after some time. Jack and Tanya got engaged in January 2006 and exchanged their vows in March 2006 in an intimate ceremony held in Big Sur, California.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kwam7zJqqZpyRq7alecGlmJyjXZa5rXnYqKxmppWasW7Azmaip6enYq6ju9StZKOZk6B6o7jAnKKsZaOku3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
