Thousands have taken to Twitter to express their frustrations with the company.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The incident has raised new questions about how much users can trust their most sensitive data not just with Apple but other companies as well. Security experts said that companies were routinely rolling out new features and products without firming up the security of the data consumers were giving up in exchange.</p><a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/236w/public/2014/09/04/3800d62ace2f8e87f4d2155ff26828b2.jpg></span></a>"In a lot of cases, consumers don't understand that when they slide a button one way or the other that they're agreeing to upload all their data," said Dennis Fisher, security evangelist for Kaspersky Lab, an internet security firm. "It's all getting very, very convoluted and complex."<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Having a company run your thermostat remotely and track something like your electricity usage may seem like a neat feature that doesn't reveal a lot of sensitive information about you. But criminals could, for example, use those trends to figure out when you're on vacation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Apple said none of the cases related to the hacking of celebrities "resulted from any breach in any of Apple's systems".</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Among security experts, the iPhone, iPad and Mac are actually considered fairly secure from viruses and hackers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But even before the hacked celebrity photos, some were criticising Apple for not doing more to protect its users' information in the cloud. The firm, for example, offers users some more advanced security options to protect their iTunes purchases, but doesn't extend the same protections to iCloud.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shortly before news of the hack broke, Apple instituted protections against "brute force" attacks, in which criminals try to obtain a user's information by flooding an account with trial-and-error attempts to guess the correct username and password. There's been no evidence that that weakness led to the pictures being leaked, but prominent security experts say it's a strong possibility.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The news has taken a toll on Apple's standing on Wall Street less than a week before its launch event. The stock dropped more than 4 per cent on Wednesday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Apple is expected to launch two new iPhones with larger screens to compete with smartphone makers like Samsung. It is also expected to announce a release date for its new mobile operating system, iOS 8, which features two new cloud platforms - HealthKit and HomeKit.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They will serve as central hubs for data collected by apps that gather fitness data and information from smart appliances.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Apple has taken some notable steps to protect particularly sensitive data. For example, HealthKit data will be stored only in encrypted form on Apple devices, rather than in the cloud. The company forbids developers from using either HealthKit or HomeKit data in advertisements.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And it's also strict in reviewing apps on its store, saying on Wednesday that it will reject apps that could threaten user security or that even feel "creepy".</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the company is far more reluctant than its competitors to speak with outside experts about its cloud security practices, making it difficult to objectively determine how secure its services are. That reluctance also limited its chances to head off vulnerabilities before they turned into hacks, as Google and Microsoft did, researchers said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Apple has to be more open to the security community," said Alexey Troshichev, founder of Russian security firm HackApp, who first identified the brute force weakness.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If Apple, the most valuable company in the world, prized security more highly, it could effect real change in the consumer tech world, experts said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So what, exactly, is keeping Apple from making its services more secure?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Perhaps the difficulty of making security easy for the average person to understand, said Lorrie Cranor, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University who focuses on privacy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It might take a really big problem to get any company to devote the resources to making secure services that are also easy to use.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cranor noted, for example, that it took the revelation that the US National Security Agency was tapping into consumer technology firms for data to get companies such as Google and Yahoo to encrypt their information by default - something security experts had advocated for years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"If Apple is concerned that people won't buy their products because they won't trust them, then they will have the incentive to fix this problem," she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"I can only guess that they've done the calculation and decided it's not that big a deal yet."</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Mighty Apple under a cloud</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miuqKqcmXyivtOimqWdX2aCeYGTaWdooJGYuKq6xmalrpyVYrCmuMSbqaKsqWK9qbvTqKpmoZOhvLawjK2fq52RqXqivM%2BlnA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
