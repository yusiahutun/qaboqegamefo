Why wouldn't she? A better question may be, why would she?
Sure, that's a presumptuous question if you just watched her audition during Sunday night's American Idol broadcast (March 1), but dig a little deeper and you'll understand why the show needed her."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

A better question may be, why would she?</p><p>Sure, that's a presumptuous question if you just watched her audition during Sunday night's American Idol broadcast (March 1), but dig a little deeper and you'll understand why the show needed her. Mascitti's timeless vocals are her calling, and she's dedicated to a classic country sound on her newest album. She's also paid her dues on songwriter stages across Nashville and worked closely with veteran Music Row songwriters, like her fiance.</p><p><a href=#>Luke Bryan</a>, Katy Perry and Lionel were impressed with Mascitti's story and voice to offer her a Golden Ticket to Hollywood. She and Shawn Camp auditioned in Savannah, Ga., last year. When&nbsp;Camp walked in, the "Knockin' Boots" singer recognized him immediately, calling him a "badass." He kind of is, as you'll&nbsp;learn below. A few of Camp's hits ("Two Pina Coladas for <a href=#>Garth Brooks</a>, "How Long Gone" for <a href=#>Brooks & Dunn</a>) were mentioned during the show, but that's just the start of it. The 53-year-old songwriter has also been writing with Mascitti and no doubt sharing stories of his own ill-fated recording contract from the mid-'90s, something that's totally worth reading about at <a href=#>NPR</a>.</p><p>The <a href=#>Canton Repository</a> is the place to go to learn more about Mascitti. They've been covering their hometown girl for nearly two decades and <a href=#>previewed her audition</a> on March 1.</p><p><strong>Who Is Lauren Mascitti?&nbsp;5 Things You Need to Know About&nbsp;Her + Shawn Camp:</strong></p><p><strong>Listen to Lauren Mascitti's "God Made a Woman":</strong></p><p><strong>See 14 Singers You Forgot Did Reality TV:&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmmqWVp7akrc1moJ2nnGK5osHRnqVmpZGosKrA06JkrKCRrLtur8Cmp2aekZjBtHnSqKWgq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
