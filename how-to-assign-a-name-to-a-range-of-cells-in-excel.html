But if you have a lot of formulas, all those cell references can get confusing. There's an easy way to remove the confusion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Excel includes a feature, called "Names", that can make your formulas more readable and less confusing. Instead of referencing a cell or range of cells, you can assign a name to that cell or range and use that name in formulas. This will make&nbsp;your formulas much easier to understand and maintain.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Use VLOOKUP in Excel</a></span></p><p>In the formula below, we reference a range of cells (in bold) from another worksheet, called "Product Database", in the same workbook. In this case, the name of the worksheet gives us a good idea as to what's contained in the range of cells, "A2:D7". However, we could use a name for this range of cells to make the formula shorter and easier to read.</p><pre>=IF(ISBLANK(A11),"",VLOOKUP(ALL,'<strong>Product Database'!A2:D7</strong>,2,FALSE))</pre><p>NOTE: For more information about the VLOOKUP function used in the formula above, see our article about <a href=#>using VLOOKUP in Excel</a>.

The cells don't have to be contiguous. To select non-contiguous cells, use the "Ctrl" key when selecting them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02_selecting_cell_range.png><p>Click the mouse in the "Name Box" above the cell grid.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/03_name_box.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Type a name for the range of cells in the box and press "Enter". For example, we called the selected cells on our "Product Database" worksheet "Products". There are syntax rules you must abide by when choosing a name. You can only begin a name with a letter, an underscore (_), or a backslash (\). The rest of the name can consist of letters, numbers, periods, and underscores. There are <a href=#>additional syntax rules</a> about what's valid and not when defining names.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/04_entering_name_in_name_box.png><p>Remember the formula from the beginning of this article? It contained a reference to the "Products Database" worksheet in the workbook and a range of cells on the that worksheet. Now, that we created the "Products" name to represent the range of cells on our "Products Database" worksheet, we can use that name in the formula, shown in bold below.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><pre>=IF(ISBLANK(A11),"",VLOOKUP(ALL,<strong>Products</strong>,2,FALSE))</pre><p>NOTE: When creating a name using the "Name Box", the <a href=#>scope of the name</a> defaults to the workbook. That means that the name is available to be used on any worksheet in the current workbook without referencing a specific worksheet. You can choose to limit the scope to a specific worksheet so the worksheet name has to be used when referring to the name, such as in the example at the beginning of this article.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/16_using_name_in_formula.png><h2 id=how-to-edit-names-using-the-name-manager>How to Edit Names Using the Name Manager</h2><p>Excel provides a tool, called "Name Manager", that makes it easy to find, edit, and delete the names in your workbook.

You can also change the range of cells to which this name is assigned by clicking the "Expand Dialog" button on the right side of the "Refers to" edit box.</p><p>NOTE: You'll see&nbsp;that the "Scope" drop-down list is grayed out. When you edit an existing name, you cannot change the "Scope" of that name. You must choose the scope when you first create the name. If you want the scope to be a specific worksheet, rather than the entire workbook, you can create a name in a way that allows you to specify the scope initially. We'll show you how to do that in a later section.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/08_edit_name_dialog.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As an example, say we added another product to our "Product Database" and we want to include it in the cell range named&nbsp;"Products".

You can use a name to represent a constant, or even a formula. For example, the worksheet below shows the exchange rate used to calculate the price in Euros for the various sizes of widgets. Because the exchange rate changes often, it would be useful if it was located in a place that's easy to find and update. Since names are easy to edit, as discussed earlier, we can create a name to represent the exchange rate and assign a value to the name.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/17_exchange_rate_on_worksheet.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Notice the formula contains an <a href=#>absolute cell reference</a> to a cell containing the current exchange rate.

Enter a name to represent the constant value, such as "ExchangeRate". To assign a value to this name, enter an equal sign (=) in the "Refers to" edit box followed by the value.
