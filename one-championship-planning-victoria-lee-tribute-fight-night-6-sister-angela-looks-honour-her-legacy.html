The event, which will air in Friday night prime time in the US on Amazon’s Prime Video streaming service, will be the martial arts promotion’s first since the tragic death of Lee on Boxing Day, which was confirmed by her sister, ONE’s atomweight MMA champion Angela Lee, last week.
The 18-year-old atomweight, who went 3-0 during a brief career in ONE, was expected to return to action on the card at Impact Arena this weekend against India’s Zeba Bano."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Keep checking on them. Give them hugs and tell them how much they mean to you. You just never know”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I don’t remember the day, I think Angela called me on December 26 or 27. It wasn’t my news or anyone’s news to tell. It’s a private matter so we have to respect it and give them the space,” Chatri said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Angela has to be the strong one. She is the strong one. For her parents. But also Ava her daughter, and her siblings, being the oldest child. But nevertheless, it doesn’t matter. It’s still so devastating.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/01/12/33171871-25ad-4b56-a8d4-cb851a8ed30d_d7491f3d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nicknamed “The Prodigy”, Victoria was also the younger sister of Christian Lee, 24, who is ONE’s welterweight and lightweight MMA champ. She had another brother, 17-year-old Adrian, whom she congratulated on winning an amateur MMA title in her final Instagram post days before her death.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Let us send our love and our prayers and our strength to the Lee family,” Chatri said. “I’m on standby 24-7, they know it, for anything possible. But everyone has got to go through the process.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Of course we will give them all the time. The only thing we can do is support them, be there as a friend. I always want to do more, but at the same time you also have to understand that the right way is to also allow them to heal as a family.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/01/12/e86c90a9-ff52-4376-90e5-d7b7ea60ac08_e21f49bc.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Victoria Lee secured three quick finishes in her first three professional fights in ONE, before taking a break last year to focus on graduating from high school.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think we all were enamoured by Victoria – not just her fighting style and skills, but her personality, her character,” Chatri said. “She was so soft-spoken, authentic, gentle, kind.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s just tragic. Her life was brief but the outpouring of love you’ve seen around the world just shows you the lives she’s touched, her character.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Luckily I have a phenomenal team and they’ve been taking care of things I would normally take care of, they took care of. I’ve definitely been in a deep funk.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mppmiqbaiuIyaqa2rX6K2ubHDZqSaqqSerq15wKurrGeRp8Gqr8ueZmxqYGuCeoKOqKWeZZOdrq68yKilrKCZpXqxuMCnpaKml2LDqq%2FTqKmimV2hsqZ506ugm62kmnqntcahq2ammZy1tXmVZqqiq6Sav26tzaCcpZldobywt9Jmn6imn6q%2FbrTEq2SlnZeWsLo%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
