We couldn‚Äôt believe our eyes when we first saw his newly clear forehead in the clip,&nbsp;no longer featuring the giant large knife between his eyes, which has truly become a&nbsp;symbol for the Atlanta-based rapper.&nbsp;‚ÄúJust got all my tattoos removed,‚Äù he claimed, showcasing his altered appearance.&nbsp;‚ÄúChanged man now. Finna go to church.‚Äù Of course, the internet freaked out,&nbsp;before realizing that he was pulling a fast one.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>21 savage is a changed man‚Ä¶ ü§î believe or disbelieve? <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/5CDt5hvwqc</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-2>‚Äî The Good News¬Æ (@ItsGoodNewz) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>September 20, 2016</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Luckily, 21 Savage decided to come forth with the truth on Sept. 21, posting a new video to his social media account which showed his signature ink still intact. ‚ÄúYa‚Äôll stupid motherf***er‚Äôs really thought I got my sh** removed, come on man.‚Äù Obviously, he utilized the magical&nbsp;wonders of a Snapchat filter!&nbsp;It would have been nearly impossible for 21 Savage&nbsp;to ditch his tattoo in such a short amount of time, since the ‚ÄúOcean Drive‚Äù lyricist just attended the 2016 BET Hip Hop Awards on Sept. 17, rocking his&nbsp;heavily-inked face!</p><h3>More Celebrity Tattoos ‚Äî See Rihanna‚Äôs Epic Ink Here</h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>It&nbsp;definitely would be a bold move for 21 Savage to change his look even more so, since&nbsp;the art from&nbsp;his 2016 album Savage Mode&nbsp;is based on his dagger&nbsp;tattoo! Nonetheless, it‚Äôs cool to see that he‚Äôs not afraid to joke around with&nbsp;his fans, who have enjoyed his music throughout the years. Not only has he recently worked with <strong>Travis Scott</strong> and <strong>Gucci Mane</strong>, his latest project featuring his hot new sound&nbsp;was released on July 15.
