The two cities are nearly 700km apart.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yang wrote that a friend had recommended he take the high-speed train to Nanchang, to visit another friend in hospital.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And when he made the trip, the story went on, Yang was surprised to find that even after visiting the friend he had time to go for dinner with relatives and see the sights, and still get back to Guangzhou late that evening.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yang wrote that the train was so fast it felt like it could “rocket to the sky at the push of a button”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I closed my eyes and let myself be absorbed by reverie. I felt like I had become the son of the wind and was riding on the winds,” he wrote.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He wrote that he balanced a HK$5 coin on the windowsill and it stayed upright as the train was travelling at about 300km/h.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/02/04/13bb0ffc-099b-11e8-82e3-6b95ccc67ee3_1320x770_221407.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The country is keeping up its investment,” he wrote. “By 2025, the total length of high-speed rail track will be 38,000km.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yang concluded that he was pleased recently to see the Hong Kong government and the China Railway Corporation sign a deal in preparation for trains to finally run along the Hong Kong section of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Hong Kong high-speed rail ‘should offer 30 per cent discount to attract passengers’</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The 26km Hong Kong section of the rail line, expected to go into use by the third quarter of this year, will link Hong Kong to mainland China’s high-speed rail network.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Under the so-called co-location plan, passengers will go through customs, immigration and quarantine procedures for both Hong Kong and the mainland at the Hong Kong terminal.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Critics have said the joint checkpoint arrangement goes against the “one country, two systems” principle because it allows national laws to be enforced in Hong Kong.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/02/04/da15c8a4-09b4-11e8-82e3-6b95ccc67ee3_1320x770_221407.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One country, two systems is the governing formula under which Beijing has ruled the city since 1997, and which guarantees the city certain freedoms which mainland Chinese cities do not get.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Hong Kong government has said it would be pointless to build the high-speed rail link without joint checkpoints. It has tabled the plan at the Hong Kong legislature, and hopes to get it passed before the end of the current legislative session in July.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It also noted that the National People’s Congress Standing Committee – China’s top legislative body – had ruled the arrangement constitutional.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0">Watch: What does ‘one country, two systems’ mean?</h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dr Chung Kim-wah, a political scientist at Polytechnic University, said he was not convinced that Yang’s piece was just a personal travelogue, and that in lavishing praise on the national express rail network Yang was adding to the case for going ahead with co-location.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The timing of the piece tells us a lot. Maybe the liaison office sees it as its mission to help the Hong Kong government promote the high-speed rail or co-location,” Chung said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He also noted that the liaison office is not supposed to interfere in local politics, and that “some Hong Kong people might feel uncomfortable when what should be politically invisible goes up to the front and becomes so politically active in Hong Kong affairs”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZop6ikmam2pL%2BOmqmtoZOhsnB%2BkGxocm1nZK%2BmtcmipaBllaPDsMXSZqeeqqOku6K4jK2pmq6VobyowcRmrZ6hnJqxbq7OqKqtZZqktq%2FA</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
