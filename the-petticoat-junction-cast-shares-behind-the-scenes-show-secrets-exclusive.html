Lori remembered laughing so hard with Linda and Meredith MacRae, who played blonde Billie Jo, that they disrupted the set. “We were shooting a church scene. One of us would make another giggle and then we’d all break out laughing,” she remembered. “We just couldn’t stop — I think we had to do five takes that day!”</p><p>The actress also got up to some mischief from a promotional stop in Atlantic City. “We did a matinee and two evening shows with singing and a little dancing — basically a big blitz for Petticoat,” remembered Lori. “We were wearing these white, thigh-high boots and we were so tired of them. After the show, we took them off and dumped them in the ocean!”</p><p>The genuine affection that bound the Petticoat gang also helped them survive the long illness and death of the show’s star, Bea Benaderet, who played the girls’ mother, Kate. “She had a tough time of it, but she was always a professional,” recalled Lori of Bea, who died from lung cancer in 1968. “Toward the end, we were shooting a scene and her hand was shaking. I put my hand over hers and we finished the scene that way.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/petticoat-junction-stars.jpg><p>Petticoat lasted for two seasons after Bea’s death. The writers sent her character off to live with relatives but occasionally a note from Kate arrived — creating many emotional moments on set. “The toughest day was when they had a letter written from Kate to Betty Jo. They had recorded Bea reading it, and I just tried not to burst out into tears during the scene,” Linda said.</p><p>In 1970, the era of rural comedies ended and the network canceled the series — although the love among the Petticoat troupe lived on. “After our show was off the air, every now and then I’d see somebody from our crew on another set, and it would be like old times,” Linda said. “We were all a family.”</p><p class=p1>For more on your favorite stars, pick up the latest issue of Closer Weekly, on newsstands now — and be sure to <a href=#>sign up for our newsletter</a> for more exclusive news!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46tn55loJrBtbXCqJitZZqqu6TAyKilZpuRqMFuv8eaqZ6rXZeyqbXNnWStoJViwKSxzZ6qZquYpMRuv8ScqZ6so2Kyua%2FLrqqirpVk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
