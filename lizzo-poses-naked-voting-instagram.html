Looking incredible, the "Juice" performer captioned the post with an impassioned message about why voting is so crucial.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"When I think of this country I don't think of its laws I think of its people. I think about how we were raised to be patriotic of violence, propaganda & war," she wrote. "I think about how this country is owned by the oppressor and how the oppressed are locked in a valley of capitalism. But I also think of the young people who refuse to be spoon fed mistruths. I think of the elders who bucked against hateful prejudices even when it felt impossible... Because of you, I’m still hopeful."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lizzo continued, "I believe in a country that teaches the true history so we can better understand where we live and how we can do better. I believe in a country that listens to the cries of the protester and doesn’t politicize death. I believe in restoration of this beautiful land and respecting the communities of people who owned America before colonizers renamed it."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though it would be easy to get distracted by Lizzo's eye-catching photo, her message was clear: "I believe in fairness, equality, a complete removal of religion in places where it does not belong. Let religion live in the churches and places of worship... the quiet prayer rooms, the joyful congregations.. and out of Congress."</p><p>She continued, "I believe in so much, and if I believe it one day I can see it. It may not be tomorrow it may not be today, but it will be one day if we stay activated. We the people, ALL the people, deserve it."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Finally, Lizzo encouraged all her fans to head to the polls. "Today's the last day to vote," she wrote. "Stay in line, stay determined and thank YOU for voting."</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/32a17ebf-adab-48ef-a723-758c53a8bea8_1524066273.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Amy Mackelden" title="Headshot of Amy Mackelden" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Amy Mackelden is a freelance writer, editor, and disability activist.
