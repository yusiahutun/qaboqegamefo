He instantly kicked off the night by referencing When They See Us actress Felicity Huffman's jail sentence, suggesting that she had made his licence plate while incarcerated. He said: "I&nbsp;came here in a limo tonight and the license plate was made by Felicity Huffman. It's her daughter I feel bad for. Must have been the most embarrassing thing thats ever happened to her - and her dad was in Wild Hogs."</p><h2>Leonardo DiCaprio</h2><p id=eKqv6bPJNYPm data-wc=53>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood star Leo was also under fire by Ricky, who joked about his reputation for dating younger women. Speaking about Leonardo attending the premiere for the film, which won Best Comedy Film, The Office actor said "by the end of it his date was too old for him".</p><h2>The awards ceremony itself</h2><p id=edt6-97RO8ZB data-wc=80>Ricky pointed out that Netflix should really have won all of the awards, saying: "No one cares about movies anymore, no one goes to the cinema... This show should just be me coming out saying, 'Well done Netflix. You've won everything. Well done, goodnight,' but no, we've got to drag it out for three hours." He added that his Netflix show After Life about a man who is suicidal following the death of his wife, is "more fun than this".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/16d43adf239f-ricky-1-z.jpg><h2>Martin Scorsese</h2><p id=ekhVcRKvdYFM data-wc=61>Ricky said: "Martin... is the greatest living director and made the news for his controversial comments on the Marvel cinema, he said they're not real films and they remind him of a theme park and I agree. But I don't know what he's doing hanging around theme parks, he's not big enough to go on the rides, is he? He's tiny!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/55193e819f60-ricky-4-z.jpg><h2>The winners</h2><p id=eSNu2ZRxsYLk data-wc=77>Ricky requested that none of the Golden Globe winners made any sort of political statement during their acceptance speech, saying: "You say you're woke but the companies you work for... if you do win an award tonight, then don't use it as a platform to make a political speech right? You're in no position to lecture the public about anything, you know nothing about the right, most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5rZ2toYGZ9d4SRb3BtZ5ekuaWxzWaepaeSmsBufo9rZ2aqmZi4unnGnqmvmZmoeq670q1kqJ6Wmru0tdWeZKOnm5rAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
