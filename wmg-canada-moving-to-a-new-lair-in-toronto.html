The world of work has become more flexible, so we’ve been able to think about our new office as a hub where people come to meet, collaborate and evolve our shared culture. And we’ve chosen a vibrant space that’s in the heart of a state-of-the-art complex which offers unrivalled amenities and is seeking to build a real sense of community. This is a bold, ambitious move that comes as we’re also stepping-up the expansion of our roster of Canadian artists, drawing from a wider than ever range of genres,” said Kristen Burke, President, Warner Music Canada.</p><p>“Warner Chappell is home to some of Canada’s most celebrated global creators, and we’re excited for our songwriters here and around the world to be able to drop in and use our writing facilities in a convenient location that’s also quickly becoming the next creative hub of Toronto. Going into a new building like this means we’ve been able to truly tailor the space to our needs, and I know our people are also really excited about the move,” added Vivian Barclay, Managing Director, Warner Chappell Music Canada.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ39wfJNoZ3Bnp6K0bq%2FAp5idmV2ivLe1zaBkraddlnqvsdZmo5qhomK2r3nTqKmopqSkfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
