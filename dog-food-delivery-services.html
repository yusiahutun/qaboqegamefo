That’s why we’ve seen a huge spike in demand for <a href=#>grocery delivery services</a>, and for dog owners, a convenient way to get healthy and nutritious meals for your beloved four-legged family members is through fresh dog food delivery services.</p><p>As dog parents, the health and well-being of our pets is a top priority, and that starts with their <a href=#>diet</a>. First and foremost, your pet’s food should meet the guidelines set forth by the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Association of American Feed Control Officials</a> (AAFCO). The AAFCO is an organization dedicated to helping consumers select dog foods that are nutritionally complete and balanced and which are “intended for supplemental feeding only.”</p><p>Dr. Zay Satchu, co-founder and chief veterinary officer of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Bond Vet</a>, tells FIRST for Women: “[The AAFCO standard] means that the balance of nutrients, vitamins, and minerals provide your dog with everything they need … for the right life stage. For example, growing puppies need a higher calorie content, while senior pets may benefit from a food for a slower metabolism.” Foods meeting these requirements are labeled with the AAFCO standard, or displayed at the brand’s website.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Customized Meal Plans</h2><p>In addition to meeting the AAFCO standards, one of the benefits of feeding your dog a fresh food diet is that the food is customized to meet the health and nutritional needs of your pet. Through Q&As, detailed profiles, and, in some instances, stool testing, you’re able to get customized meal plans that best suit your pet.&nbsp;</p><p>While freshly made dog food tends to land at a higher price point than dry dog foods, these recipes are vet-developed and packed with superfoods, high-quality meat, and no by-products like artificial flavors or preservatives. With fresh dog food, you’re ensuring the highest quality of ingredients for your pet in each meal</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fresh Dog Food Delivery Services and COVID-19</h2><p>For the majority of companies preparing fresh dog food for their clients, it’s business as usual. Most companies aren’t experiencing any delay at this time, and are able to source the high-quality ingredients they’ve always been able to find.&nbsp;</p><p>However, companies are taking extra steps to protect their employees and ensure the quality of their products. In a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recent announcement</a>, NomNomNow explained: “For our on-site staff members, we’ve added extra daily health and safety briefings, sanitation procedures and wash breaks. We’ve also added shifts to both enforce social distancing and to ensure every pet who needs food has it.”</p><p>NomNomNow also mentioned that they’re offering “extra meals for those who feel the need to have more pet food on hand,” which means you can reduce the number of shipments you typically get to your home, but increase the amount of food you get per shipment.</p><p>There are several companies now that deliver fresh, often pre-proportioned, dog food right to your doorstep. And if you’re looking for a way to feed your pet high-quality fresh dog food, these services are very convenient.&nbsp;</p><p>And remember: You should always consult your veterinarian before starting your pet on a new diet to ensure they get the correct balance of nutrients, vitamins, and minerals.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Keep scrolling for FIRST for Women‘s top picks for the best fresh dog food delivery services for you and your pup.&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 class=block-product__title><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The Farmer’s Dog</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/05/The-Farmers-Dog.png><h3 class=block-product-list__title></h3><ul><li>From $2 per day</li><li>Free shipping</li><li>Personalized packaging</li></ul><p>With over 10,000,000 meals delivered nationwide, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>The Farmer’s Dog</strong></a> is one of the best-known fresh dog food services available today.

What is a microbiome test, you ask? Well, first, microbiome refers to the “genetic material of microbes in a particular environment, like your pet’s gut” according to the NomNomNow website. And the test is performed on a sample of your pet’s stool. All you need to do is collect a sample and mail it back to their lab in a package they provide. The test results, which you receive in three to six weeks, reveal information about your pet’s gut health based on a comprehensive analysis conducted by scientists. And then the information from the test helps you better tailor your pet’s diet.</p><p>If your pet experiences any chronic symptoms like diarrhea or vomiting, abnormally fluctuating weight, or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">other health issues</a>, a personalized diet plan could help to address these health issues. And with flavors like Chicken Chow, Beef Mash, Turkey Fare, and Pork Potluck, your pet will love this fresh food.</p><a class=block-product__cta href=#>sign up now<span class=block-product__cta-icon></span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJop56so2SxsLOMn6aonF2Zsq211Z6psmWjmr%2B3tcKeqg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
