Many are old familiars. And a handful have been there since the beginning. But no matter the case, downtown Laurel will be jam-packed with vendors this Saturday, all eager to feature their handiwork at Laurel’s largest annual party, the Loblolly Festival.</p><p>And with the return of fall-like weather finally in the forecast, upwards of 30,000 visitors are expected to be there also, enjoying the food, fun and fabrications of the signature event that has been presented by Laurel Main Street since 2008.</p><p>The Loblolly Festival celebrates Laurel’s roots as a sawmill town, where the native loblolly pine was harvested and shipped all over to help build America in the late 19th century.</p><p>Admission and parking for Loblolly are free and the festivities will take place from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on virtually every street in the downtown area.</p><p>Officials are planning for a record 250-plus booths, with vendors coming from all over the South to showcase their unique goods. Some are coming from as far away as Georgia, Tennessee and Florida.</p><p>“We have quite a few newbies this year,” Laurel Main Street Executive Director Caroline Burks said, adding that one of every four vendors will be Loblolly newbies.</p><p>Bringing folks downtown to see the amazing progress taking place is a goal of the annual event’s organizers.</p><p>“I live in Laurel and just haven’t been able to get downtown a lot lately,” first-time vendor Adam Lack said. His new business, Lacknothin’ Kettle Corn Co., offers 22 flavors of delightfulness, including one special flavor — Coach Bo’s mix.</p><p>“I used to always enjoy buying corn and other treats from Coach Dennis Bohannon in the mall,” Lack said, “so we created a special flavor to honor his memory.”</p><p>Barry Broome and his family will be making their second trip from near Seminary to showcase their business, Emma Wilder Farms.</p><p>“We have been doing festivals for around four years, but last year was our first Loblolly,” Broome said. “I was extremely impressed with the foot traffic, and I mean everyone there was just so nice.” So Broome and his family made Loblolly a priority event this year for their farm, which offers various goat-milk products.</p><p>“We actually have a customer in Michigan, and she is taking her vacation to come down for the Loblolly Festival to meet us in person and visit,” Broome said.</p><p>The festival will feature great live music at two stages: The Knight Butcher stage on Central Avenue and a stage near Front Street and Spec Wilson Boulevard. All the musical acts this year are 100 percent local.</p><p>Kids of all ages will enjoy free art experiences, rides, jumps and for the older kids — or possibly a brave adult or two — a mechanical bull and jousting pit.</p><p>One attraction back by popular demand is Dayton Scoggins, an award-winning chainsaw sculptor and artist who can take an idea and make it come to life in an original piece of art.</p><p>The streets will be filled with interesting and unique treasures, such as one-of-a-kind jewelry made by Jan Cade and her business, The Gypsy’s Moon. The pieces are created from antique and vintage items created by Cade, who is making her fourth trip to Loblolly.</p><p>“My jewelry fits right into the special feel of Laurel,” Cade said. “The Loblolly Festival is a very well-run event with great foot traffic and a real variety of vendors.”</p><p>Linda Maxey and her Nana’s Salsa will be back for a fourth time, and Maxey is hoping to bring enough of her tasty creation since she sold all 15 cases at last year’s Loblolly.</p><p>“The last year was simply unreal,” Maxey said. “But I just enjoy getting out and meeting new people and seeing old friends.”</p><p><strong>If you go</strong></p><p>What: Loblolly Festival</p><p>Where: Downtown Laurel</p><p>When: Saturday, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p><p>Admission: Free</p><p>Parking: Free</p><p>Food: West Oak Street</p><p>Music: Thomas Jackson, Jones & Pine, Attic Revival, Stephen Wade Scott and the Low Spirits</p><p>Vendor Maps: <a href=#>www.facebook.com/laurelmainstreet</a></p><p>Available by QR code at the Laurel Main Street tent</p><p>Info: <a href=#>www.laurelmainstreet.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwstGenJimlazAcL7EnKarnF2jwq6uxKtkqJ5dq7KvsM6rqmannmLBoryMn6arZZykr627y6WwaJmiqbakuMSYbmyZaZh%2FdLGMb2pxcV1mfqaxjJtsn5tdmbN2f5admGtoYm2Ab7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
