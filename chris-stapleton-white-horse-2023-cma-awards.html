Despite being placed on vocal rest in October, his iconic raspy vocals showed no signs of fatigue.
The slow-building song captured the television and live audience's attention, erupting with a short guitar solo at the very end.
Stapleton's eyes blazed as he performed the love song. Wife Morgane stood beside him throughout, and his trusted band — including Paul Franklin on steel guitar — did all they could to keep up."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

At the time, the idea was to create a rock-driven Western song. He officially released "White Horse" on July 21, 2023 as the lead single off his fifth studio album, Higher. The upcoming project is scheduled to be released on Friday, Nov. 10.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/townsquare.media/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/tasteofcountry.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>The "You Should Probably Leave" singer was also nominated for a handful of CMA Awards.
