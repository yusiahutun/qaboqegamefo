 The singer was performing on Friday night at Madison Square Gardens when there was, what manager Irving Azoff described as &#34;sound problems&#34; which led at least some members of the audience to suspect that Aguilera might have been merely miming her performance.
 In a statement to the New York Daily News, Azoff said &#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Milli Vanilli experienced a career-ending CD skip while performing "live" at Lake Compounce amusement park in Connecticut. The incident, caught on tape by MTV was pounced upon by music critics. The incident led to the revelation that they duo did not even sing on some of their records and they became the subject of numerous lawsuits and were dropped by their label, Arista.</p><p>More recently, Singer/Actress Ashlee Simpsons appeared on SNL on October 23rd. Her first song went normally, but when the singer took stage to perform the second of the night, the vocals for the first song started again, before she had started to 'sing' the second tune. Discretion apparently being the better part of valor, Simpson left the stage rather than continue with the performance. She later claimed that she had been experiencing voice problems but the hoi-palloi seemed disaffected. She was subsequently booed at the Orange Bowl and her 2nd album failed to meet sales expectations. – CelebrityAccess Staff Writers</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaJuRlr%2BktMivnGicn5rAbq%2FHq6CsrJmjrm6txq6gpZ2ilnqttc9mqrKmk2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
