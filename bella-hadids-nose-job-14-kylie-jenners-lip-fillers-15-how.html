The physicalOne of the most important factors to consider when deciding if someone under the age of 18 is ready for plastic surgery is whether the parts of their body in question have fully developed yet.
Different parts of the body develop at a different pace, with some changing well into your mid-20s."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It’s crucial that they’re getting the procedure done for themselves and not to please their parents, friends or significant others.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The same goes for the reasoning behind why they want the procedure. On most occasions, young people want to change something to look more like a celebrity they admire, or feel pressured to do it because of insecurities and how their peers perceive them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/03/24/0821bf50-cb70-4a0a-a4f7-a658c2250d39_7d6f329d.jpg>A few years ago, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Kylie Jenner</span></a> admitted she had her lips done at a young age, saying that she was 15 and insecure about her lips.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I have really small lips. And it was like one of my first kisses, and a guy was like, ‘I didn’t think you would be a good kisser because you have such small lips.’ I took that really hard,” she said on television.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The boy’s statement led to Jenner getting lip fillers for the first time. “I would overline my lips … to create the illusion of bigger lips, and then, finally, I was like, this lip liner isn’t doing it and ended up getting my lips done.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/03/24/5436bf29-9182-4358-8b70-4ae6370ee22a_084be25c.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">The recovery</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">People tend to forget how challenging the recovery process after surgery can be. Plastic surgery is still surgery, and it involves pain, discomfort, swelling, bruises and a long healing journey.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This process means you go through a lot before seeing actual results, and accepting a period of time when you’ll look “worse” before you finally get the features you’ve always dreamed of.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This phase can be difficult for teenagers, as they don’t always understand surgery can’t miraculously transform their bodies but is instead a way to emphasise their natural features.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/03/24/61e44d52-ee40-4d6e-b79c-19e342035b06_6ba2d6d8.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">When is plastic surgery acceptable?</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In most countries, people under the age of 18 are not allowed to undergo plastic surgery without full written consent from their parents or guardian.
