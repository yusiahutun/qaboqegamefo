"But, it was the behavior after that really told me that she wasn't sorry."</p><p>Eager to see her sisters move forward, Kim urges the pair to patch things up, but Kyle's not so sure she's ready yet.</p><p>"I miss my family. I miss our lunches. I miss our barbecues, I miss our fun together, as a family," Kim says. "And two, this wedding's coming up and then Farrah's..."</p><p>"... But what if I don't want that relationship?" Kyle asks.</p><p>While Kyle is open to repairing their relationship, should Kathy approach her with genuine, good intentions, one thing the mother of four said she won't stand for, is being "mistreated" by her sister.</p><p>"She can't have a conversation like this," Kyle tells Kim, her voice audibly breaking as things get more emotional. "She gets so mean. I really can't handle the meanness, like the way that she talks."</p><p>She continues, "I don't like that. It freaked me out when I was little. I don't like that kind of thing... I just can't have someone be that mean and talk like that. If she wants to have a conversation, I could do it, but it's not about a conversation with her."</p><p>That hits a nerve with Kim and Kyle, who can't help but compare Kathy's demeanor to their late mother, Kathleen, who she said had a "fiery" temper.</p><p>Still prompting her sister to "try" and fix things with Kathy, Kim calls their spat "silly," before reminding Kyle that this rift between the pair is something their mom never would have wanted.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:96e0f8aa-440e-4e42-a8ad-e90c8ee775ef data-container-ref=toofab:article:6094feb1-c21b-427a-afe8-43b9dc12bb38 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ee/5by4/2023/12/05/eee350e6cc82452b8c7f2cc303922f87_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo/Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kyle Richards Tells Sutton Stracke to 'Go F--k Yourself' After 'Low Blow' Comment About Her Sisters</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I'll tell you one thing," Kim says, holding back tears. "Mom never wanted this kind of stuff. She was all about us sticking together... friends come and go, and people come and go, family stays, and that was mom."</p><p>The fighting among the sisters -- past spats with Kim and Kyle, and this feud between Kathy and Kyle -- have provided Kim with a better understanding of their mother, who she admits she was angry with for some time.</p><p>"I'm not angry. I love her," Kim cries. "She gave up her whole life for us."</p><p>The sisters break down, each reflecting on their relationship with their mom, and this big divide amongst their family that seems much deeper than just post-reunion social media comments from Kathy.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:fc8de6f6-af8e-4e19-9833-7b352dbfa6d1 data-container-ref=toofab:article:6094feb1-c21b-427a-afe8-43b9dc12bb38 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e0/5by4/2023/12/28/e0b406e14e984925bf99d5a01770b713_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kyle Richards Shares Update on Weight Loss & Marriage After Spending Holidays with Mauricio Umansky</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"It makes you realize the things that hurt me so much," Kim says while embracing her younger sister. "And I just love her so much and I know... I get it. And I think that you love Kathy and Kathy loves and I think that sometimes, we think about it maybe... think about why, why? Maybe there's underlying something else."</p><p>Apprehensive to be hurt again by her sister, Kyle continues to push back, but appears more open to squashing things after this heartfelt conversation with Kim, who seems to truly think there's hope for Kyle and Kathy yet.</p><p>"You guys think about what's best for you," Kim urges.</p><p>It does seem like Kyle and Kathy are in a better place now, hitting the red carpet together for a holiday party back in December. We'll see if their reconciliation makes air as new episodes of RHOBH air Wednesday nights on Bravo.</p><a id=gallery-link-93348768-7ce1-4d4c-9ae4-28758d7de018 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:93348768-7ce1-4d4c-9ae4-28758d7de018 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:6094feb1-c21b-427a-afe8-43b9dc12bb38 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/41/4by3/2023/11/29/4199293fd6f94fa9a246eb96ed134133_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2pmaWxfoMatsYyroJygkaextHnKmquhsV2dtq3Azqdkq52glrazedGeo5qsmaS7tLTIqWSroJ%2BXtXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
