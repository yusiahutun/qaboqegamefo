Tight-knit fabrics have no (or few) holes for hairs to get stuck in, whereas loosely-woven fabrics make for the perfect environment to collect fur and other debris.&nbsp;</p><p>Other factors to bear in mind are how sticky a material is. Fabrics such as velvet, nylon, velour, loosely-woven cotton, chenille, <a href=# rel=noopener>linen</a>, and acrylic, are among the worst fabrics for pet hair, as they tend to attract fuzz and dust. As such, it would be best to steer clear of these and any other high-static materials when shopping for the perfect pet-friendly comforter. Highly-textured fabrics can also easily trap pet hair in their threads, so it’s best to avoid those, too.&nbsp;</p><p>The best bedding fabrics for repelling pet hair are made with tightly-woven materials, such as canvas, tight-knit cottons, microfiber, rayon, satin, and silk. Fur will have a hard time sticking to these types of materials, allowing you to easily shake it off or wipe it away with a cloth.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How do you get dog hair out of a comforter?&nbsp;</h2><p>Regularly vacuuming your comforter with the <a href=# rel=noopener>best vacuum for pet hair</a> is a must. Choose a vacuum with an air-tight seal that traps allergens and dust-mites. Many vacuums come with attachments specifically designed to remove pet hair (like this <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Shark Rotator Professional Upright</a>).</p><p>Another big factor to take into consideration when shopping for the best comforter for pets is whether or not your duvet or comforter is machine-washable, as fur — combined with other potential accidents — means you’ll probably have to put it in the washer more often than not.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What color bedding hides dog hair?</h2><p>That depends on the color of your pet’s hair. My dog is white, so beiges, grays, and warm tones tend to match his fur. Dogs and cats with darker color manes will camouflage with dark gray, navy, and even black-colored bedding.</p><p>First For Women has affiliate partnerships so we may receive compensation for some links to products and services.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Overall Best Comforters&nbsp;for&nbsp;Dog Hair</h2><h2 class=block-product__title><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Lauren Ralph Lauren Lightweight Down Alternative Comforter</a></h2><span class=block-product__eyebrow>Best Designer Comforter for Pet Hair</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/5-best-comforters-for-pet-hair-ralph-lauren.jpg><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Macy’s, starting at $156</a></strong></p><h3 class=block-product-list__title>Why we like it:</h3><ul><li>233-thread count cotton cover</li><li>Machine washable</li><li>Lightweight with Lite Loft polyester fill</li></ul><p>Sleeping with bedding that bears Ralph Lauren’s name is a dream you and your canine companion won’t want to wake up from.

It washes nicely (I run a few additional spin cycles to get as much water out — this fabric is very absorbent, so more spin cycles just helps with the drying time).
