It features nine attractive contestants – five men and four women – trapped on an island nicknamed “Inferno” for nine days. The singles are left with limited necessities, and they have to cook food and draw water on their own. They are also prohibited from disclosing personal information.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, there’s a twist: if two of the contestants click, they can escape the island to be sent to a luxury resort nicknamed “Paradise”. During their stay there, contestants can open up about their ages and professions, and can talk more freely with their dates.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/04/4b887859-bd93-4472-8fbf-83904b24e0ea_6000aa26.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One of the contestants who’s made a strong impression is Song Ji-a. When she was introduced, the guys immediately took notice of her. The show revealed that she’s a fashion and beauty content creator and majored in Korean traditional dance at Hanyang University.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As we anticipate the series’ final episode on January 8, we look beyond Song’s alluring personality to see what makes her so fascinating. Just who is she when the cameras aren’t rolling?</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">10 most powerful Korean celebrities of 2021, from BTS to Blackpink</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">She’s very straightforward with what she likes</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/04/1851e803-9ce4-47ce-9daa-90c57aade4ae_32f73604.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the first episode, Song admitted that what she sees in a guy first is his physical appearance. She also added that personality and money are important to her.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Outside of the show, she has echoed this sentiment and revealed that she has high standards. Song recently uploaded a Q&A video and responded to a fan’s assumption that she must not have crushes for long: “It’s hard for me to have a crush on anybody. My standards are as high as Mount Everest. I don’t have anybody around me to have a crush on yet. And I don’t think I’ll have to lower them for a man.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">She gives back to her fans</strong></h3>Many K-pop idols are known for <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">giving generous gifts to their fans</span></a> – and so is Song. During the winter holidays, Song vlogged about buying Adidas jackets worth 10 million won (US$8,400) for her fans, whom she refers to as “Pringies”. Aside from delivering the items to her fans personally, she also had quick conversations with them and gifted them with photocards.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">K-pop idols’ most epic wedding dresses, from Lee Hyori to Hyerim</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">She resembles K-pop idols</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/04/debb72ee-d7fc-462b-b9e6-620fb4a4fb39_d2ecae96.jpg>In 2020, according to Koreaboo, Song starred as a guest on talk show Video Star where she proved her mettle as a dance major, performing a graceful, self-choreographed routine to BTS’ Boy with Luv. The hosts commented that she resembles Blackpink’s Jennie, and she has also previously taken a photo alongside another of her lookalikes, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Wonyoung of up-and-coming girl band, Ive</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Without giving names, she also revealed that she has dated celebrities, and that they would slide into her DMs to say hello.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">She’s fashionable</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/04/b2844006-c5d4-4f4a-8874-b4845099d220_7390c88c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fashion runs in Song’s blood. Despite living on a remote island in Single’s Inferno, she managed to dress impeccably and present herself well. In the first episode, she wore a Chanel blouse while cooking. When she had a heart-to-heart talk with one of the guys, she toted a Prada bag.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her feminine style and preference for luxury labels is also reflected in her social media. In her posts, she can be seen wearing Alexander McQueen outfits and posing in a Louis Vuitton T-shirt.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">How much did K-drama’s biggest stars make per episode in 2021?</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">She has a pet dog with its own Instagram following</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/04/5e8143b1-a9d2-4126-9102-446733e23a44_7390c88c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">From time to time, Song posts pictures of Mongchi, her pet dog, and even has a separate Instagram account dedicated to him. She loves to pamper him, including dressing him in a tweed jacket that matched her own.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZpydnJqvs7XTsmaaqqSesK2xjmxob2pgboNwucSeq2armaO0rbHSZqCnnpWnu7B50q2Yq2WjpLuoecmiZKSnopqur3nYqKytrZKav26tzZ0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
