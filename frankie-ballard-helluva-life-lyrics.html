"And it even goes so far as to say you should appreciate the bad times because they make the good times better."</p><p>"It was incredibly parallel with what was going on in my life," the singer adds of the 'Helluva Life' lyrics. "It’s such an appropriate thing for me to be releasing as my first single off the new project. I thought my first single was gonna come out and, ka-pow, be off to the races, but that didn’t happen. But at the end of the day, I feel very blessed to be in the game and to have a new single."</p><p>Frankie Ballard's 'Sunshine & Whiskey' is out Feb. 11.</p><a class="next-post cto" href=#>Listen to Frankie Ballard, 'Helluva Life'</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmn6qRo7iqsYybmKWkkaexbrTEpaOurpFiuaqyxGajsqqZmMBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
