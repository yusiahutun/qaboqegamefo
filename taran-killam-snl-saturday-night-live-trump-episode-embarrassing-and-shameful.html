It was not enjoyable at the time and something that only grows more embarrassing and shameful as time goes on," Killam explained. "I don't necessarily put so much weight into [the idea of] Trump hosting 'SNL' helping him become president, but there's definitely something where it normalizes him and it makes it OK for him to be part of the conversation. And I don't think the intention of having him on was ever politically based. I sincerely believe that. But I don't think it was considered — the implications that it had then and could have moving forward."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:d87880ae-343b-5a35-a19a-4fe10da06a05 data-container-ref=toofab:article:39e7f49d-6ddc-5eae-a44e-9053625cd3c6 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b0/5by4/2017/10/01/b0c37bbdc58f57f3a23ebde28d4d1744_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h4 class=article-block__card-title>'SNL' Fans Applaud Michael Che for Calling Trump a 'B-tch,' 'Cheap Cracker' Over Puerto Rico Response</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I think looking back ... there's nothing good I can take from that week," he continued. "Because he's not an enjoyable person to be around — he's from a different class; he's from a different way of life. There was never any common ground."</p><p>The actor said the cast could "hear protests during our table read" as Trump's detractors shouted "No Trump!" outside. "I am embarrassed, upon reflection, just because of how everyone was right," he says now, "Every person outside of that building protesting was absolutely right."</p><p>Killam also shared what he considers "the most heartbreaking moment" from Trump's week. "We're at the host dinner, and he brings Melania and he brings Ivanka and Jared [Kushner]. And he says [to Lorne Michaels], 'You know, Lorne, if I don't win this thing, I'm gonna be fine. We just bought this beautiful piece of property in Scotland. If I have to be president, I'm never gonna see that thing.' And that that was his priority in that moment, that that was even a consideration, made me sad."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:8cf24523-cde5-5f9a-b7ce-7324e1482b96 data-container-ref=toofab:article:39e7f49d-6ddc-5eae-a44e-9053625cd3c6 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=30><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/9c/5by4/2017/10/01/9cdb1adb9e785981901b048cce3c4b69_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h4 class=article-block__card-title>Ranking 'SNL' Premiere Sketches From Worst to First: Ryan Gosling Saves Jazz, LOLs Through Sketches, Loves a Chicken</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"SNL" has been railing on POTUS pretty regularly now, something Killam had no problem calling them out for.</p><p>"It certainly feels like there's some hypocrisy there. I guess you could say, 'Oh, they're righting wrongs.' And I don't even think it's righting wrongs. I think the show tries to — and in particular, Lorne's outlook is — play to both sides," he added. "Play to the masses, play to whatever the popular opinion is. But, boy, they could definitely mine some comedy out of owning up to it, huh?"</p><p>Taran's run at "SNL" ended in 2016, after he was let go six years into his seven-season contract.</p><a id=gallery-link-93489945-ca1a-5a24-b448-419d6258fd4b class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:93489945-ca1a-5a24-b448-419d6258fd4b data-poster-image-ref=toofab:image-asset:image_jpg_20171013_2d572309aff354d49108bd4b1411276d data-start-at-poster data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:39e7f49d-6ddc-5eae-a44e-9053625cd3c6 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/2d/4by3/2017/10/13/2d572309aff354d49108bd4b1411276d_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnh7kGlmam9fqa6zrc1moqKknJa6br%2FNpWSsmaSqv6Wt2Galop%2BYqXqttdWeZK2qpaK9brHPoqqonJVisq6uwKupmqujnruoecCnm2armJa6prLUpWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
