Below, we detail some lesser-known features of Telegram that you may have overlooked until now.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=migrate-phone-numbers-or-add-a-second-number>1. Migrate Phone Numbers, or Add a Second Number</h2><p>Have you ever needed to change your phone number but worried about transferring all your contacts and other information to the new number? While this can be a lot of work, Telegram does it all for you. You can easily change the phone number attached to your account without losing any of your chats or contacts.</p><p>To change the number you use with Telegram, open <strong>Settings</strong> (which is inside the left menu on Android). On iPhone, in the next menu, tap <strong>Edit</strong> in the top-right corner. This step isn't necessary on Android.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Then choose <strong>Change Number</strong> and follow the instructions. This will move all messages, clients, and media to your new mobile number. Plus, Telegram will automatically add your new number in the address books of all your contacts.</p>2 Images <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/01a-Telegram-Options.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/01b-Telegram-Change-Number.png> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>If you want to add a second number instead of migrating, Telegram also lets you use multiple accounts at once. For Android, on the left sidebar, tap your contact info to expand the account switcher and choose <strong>Add Account</strong>. On iPhone, tap <strong>Edit</strong> on the profile page and choose <strong>Add Another Account</strong>.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>You can use this to, for example, keep your personal and professional lives separate on Telegram without having to use another messenger app.</p><h2 id=upload-multiple-profile-pictures-to-telegram>2. Upload Multiple Profile Pictures to Telegram</h2><p>Speaking of multiples, Telegram allows you to upload additional profile photos. While the latest photo is the profile picture your contacts will see, they can swipe to see the rest of your pictures.</p><p>To upload new profile images, open <strong>Settings</strong>. On Android, tap on the <strong>camera</strong> icon at the top-right. On iPhone, tap the <strong>Edit</strong> button and choose <strong>Set New Photo or Video</strong>.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>You can take a new photo, upload an existing one, search the web for a new image, or remove your current photo.</p><p>Tap your profile picture here to see everything you've uploaded in the past. You can scroll across them; tap the <strong>Set as Main Photo</strong> option that appears on the top-right menu (as three dots on Android or <strong>Edit</strong> on iPhone) to set an older image as your current profile picture.</p>2 Images <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/02a-Telegram-New-Photo.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/02b-Telegram-Profile-Photos.png> <span class=txt>Close</span><h2 id=try-secret-telegram-chats>3. Try Secret Telegram Chats</h2><p>While all Telegram chats are client-server encrypted, default chats are still stored on Telegram's servers. This conveniently allows you to access your messages on multiple devices, but it might raise privacy concerns.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>For maximum privacy, you can <a href=#>create secret chats that use end-to-end encryption</a>. These aren't stored on Telegram's servers, so you can only access them with your specific phone. If one party deletes a message, it disappears on both devices. And you can specify a self-destruct period for all media if you like.</p><p>On Android, simply slide out the left menu and choose <strong>New Secret Chat</strong> to start a new one. On iPhone, open a chat, tap the contact's name at the top, choose <strong>More</strong>, and then hit <strong>Start Secret Chat</strong>.</p><h2 id=customize-the-look-of-telegram>4. Customize the Look of Telegram</h2><p>In Telegram, you can adjust the color and background. If you like, you can even set up your own custom theme to make Telegram look exactly the way you like.</p><p>To adjust the theme, go to <strong>Settings > Chat Settings</strong> on Android, or <strong>Settings > Appearance</strong> on iOS. Here you can change the text size, bubble colors, night mode settings, and similar options. Choose <strong>Chat Background</strong> to set a new wallpaper for your groups.</p><p>To create your own theme, tap the <strong>three-dot</strong> button (Android) or go to <strong>Chat Themes</strong> (iOS) and choose <strong>Create new theme</strong>. Here, you can create your own look if you don't like any of the default options.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> 3 Images <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/03a-Telegram-Chat-Options.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/03b-Telegram-New-Theme.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/03c-Telegram-Chat-Background.png> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>Even better, thanks to Cloud Themes, you can share your custom themes (or try themes created by others) using a link. If the owner updates the theme, everyone using it through that link will see the changes. Long-press on a theme and choose <strong>Share</strong> to make it available to others.</p><p>To find more themes, Android users can try the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Themes for Telegram app</a>. If you use an iPhone, have a look at the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Telegram Themes subreddit</a>.</p><h2 id=utilize-telegram-bots>5. Utilize Telegram Bots</h2><p>Like many communication apps, Telegram includes chatbots. Bots add useful functions both on their own and into your chats; they can do everything from checking the weather to playing games.</p><p>There are thousands of bots available on Telegram. We've sorted through them and picked out <a href=#>the best Telegram bots you should use</a>.</p><h2 id=enable-auto-night-mode>6. Enable Auto-Night Mode</h2><p>Do you enjoy using both light and dark modes? Telegram has an auto-night feature so the app doesn't blind you at night.</p><p>To use it, go back to <strong>Settings > Chat Settings</strong> (Android) or <strong>Settings > Appearance</strong> (iOS). Select <strong>Auto-Night Mode</strong> to choose how it works.</p>2 Images <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/04a-Telegram-Night-Mode-Schedule.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/04b-Telegram-Night-Mode-Ambient.png> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>You'll have four options to choose from:</p><ul><li><strong>System Default</strong> (Android) or <strong>System</strong> (iOS): Matches the theme to your operating system's current mode.</li><li><strong>Scheduled:</strong> Night mode will start when the sun goes down and turn off when the sun rises again. If you like, you can instead set your own times for it to turn off and on.</li><li><strong>Adaptive</strong> (Android) or <strong>Automatic</strong> (iOS): The mode will automatically switch based on the light level around you; you can define the threshold.</li><li><strong>Disabled:</strong> Turn off automatic night mode and always use the chosen theme.</li></ul><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>This page also lets you select your preferred night mode theme.</p><h2 id=mute-contacts-and-groups>7. Mute Contacts and Groups</h2><p>If you're part of many Telegram chats—maybe you joined too many of <a href=#>the best Telegram channels</a>—they can quickly become annoying. When this happens, you can always mute a chat without leaving it. This way, you can check it on your own terms instead of getting a ping for every new message.</p><p>On Android, tap the three-dot <strong>Menu</strong> button in the top-right of any Telegram chat and choose <strong>Mute notifications</strong>. On iOS, tap the contact or group name at the top of the screen and choose <strong>Mute</strong>. Then you can choose to mute the chat for various periods of time, or forever.</p>2 Images <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/05a-Telegram-Mute-Option.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/05b-Telegram-Mute-Length.png> <span class=txt>Close</span><h2 id=share-your-live-location>8. Share Your Live Location</h2><p>Sharing your location lets others keep an eye on your progress to a destination or help look out for your safety. In Telegram, open a chat, tap the <strong>paper clip</strong> button, and choose <strong>Location</strong> to share it.</p><p>You can choose to share either your current or your live location. <strong>Send My Current Location</strong> will provide a one-time update about where you are. As you can see in the below image, the app lets you manually change this before sending, so don't trust locations blindly. In addition to manually selecting a point on the map, you can choose a nearby place from a list.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><strong>Share My Live Location</strong> continually updates that chat for the period you specify. Be careful about giving away too much information when using this.</p>2 Images <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/06a-Telegram-Attachment-Options.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/06b-Telegram-Location-Share.png> <span class=txt>Close</span><h2 id=connect-with-a-proxy-server>9. Connect With a Proxy Server</h2><p>If you want to use Telegram in a region where it's blocked, you'll appreciate the Telegram function that allows you to connect via a proxy server. Most of the time, it's better to <a href=#>use a VPN on your phone</a>, but a proxy can still help you get around regional restrictions.</p><p>To use a proxy server in Telegram, open <strong>Settings > Data and Storage > Proxy Settings</strong>. Enable <strong>Use Proxy</strong> and you'll need to fill in all the required information to add it. You can find server info for this online if needed.</p>2 Images <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/07a-Telegram-Enable-Proxy.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/07b-Telegram-Proxy-Options.png> <span class=txt>Close</span><h2 id=take-advantage-of-telegram-chat-tools>10. Take Advantage of Telegram Chat Tools</h2><p>Telegram offers a few other handy options in chats. You can delete any message by long-pressing it, then hitting the <strong>Trash</strong> icon that appears. The app lets you delete messages at any time—even messages that the other person sent in a chat.</p><p>Telegram also supports hashtags. If you tap a hashtag, you can search across all of your activate chats for it. This makes it easy to find messages in the future or categorize information for yourself.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Signal vs. Telegram: Which Secure Messaging App Is Better?</a></span></p><p>Another great option in groups or channels is being able to pin messages. Tap a message and choose <strong>Pin</strong> to keep it at the top of the chat, where everyone can easily reference it.</p><p>There's also a hidden menu that appears when you long-press on the <strong>Send</strong> button. Choose <strong>Schedule message</strong> to delay sending until a time in the future. You can also tap <strong>Send When Online</strong> to send the message when the other person is next active on Telegram.</p>3 Images <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/08a-Telegram-Pin-Messages.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/08b-Telegram-Sending-Options.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/08c-Telegram-Schedule-Options.png> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>Finally, if you don't want to disturb the other person, choose <strong>Send without sound</strong> to silently deliver the message to the other party without them getting a notification.</p><p>The cool features of Telegram aren't all so serious, though.

Take Control of Telegram Privacy and Security</h2>2 Images <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/09a-Telegram-Privacy-Options.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/09b-Telegram-Privacy-Choices.png> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>Because Telegram lets you interact with people even if you aren't in each other's contacts, you may wish to make your account more private. To change privacy options, head to <strong>Settings > Privacy and Security</strong>. Here, you can change who can see your phone number, active status, and more.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Telegram also includes useful security options in this menu, which differ in name slightly on Android and iPhone. Use <strong>Passcode Lock</strong> to keep people from reading your chats. You can review all <strong>Active Sessions</strong> and terminate any logins that you no longer use.</p><p>And under <strong>Advanced</strong>, you can change how much time must pass with no activity before Telegram will automatically delete your account.</p><h2 id=save-messages-you-want-to-access-anywhere>12.

The <strong>Saved Messages</strong> chat is your own personal cloud scratchpad for keeping a record of information that you can access on any device where you're logged into Telegram.</p><p>To save a message from elsewhere in Telegram, tap it, choose <strong>Forward</strong>, and select <strong>Saved Messages</strong> to add it instantly. You can also paste text, links, images, and anything else you'd like from other sources.</p><p>This is incredibly useful for keeping track of an important URL, getting an image to another device without cloud storage, or keeping a record of important information. Tap the title bar at the top to browse by media type and make it easier to find past messages you saved.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=use-these-great-telegram-features-to-become-a-pro>Use These Great Telegram Features to Become a Pro</h2><p>With these features, you're ready to become an advanced Telegram user and take full advantage of the app. There are lots of little touches around the app that make it a joy to use, so you may find even more.</p><p>Telegram is a great all-around messenger, especially when you start using its best features and know everything it's capable of.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9fqsCmstSlZK2dnJq0s63MZp2emaSqv6a%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
