I don't know, it was 10 o'clock on a Thursday," he added, to which Oshry said, "that's not an off night."</p><p>Jax, 43, then shared a "rumor" he's heard about the bar, saying that he's been told, "They are trying to buy [out]" Sandoval. He went on to claim that he was offered to invest in Schwartz & Sandys himself.</p><p>"In fact, they offered me, if I was interested in taking over," Jax told Oshry. "Could you imagine?"</p><p>"I don't know if it was a strong offer or not," he continued. "I was at the bar late at night, and one of the managers or owners of Schwartz & Sandy's [was] like, 'Hey, we want to get rid of Tom Sandoval. We want to find another buyer. Would you be interested?'"</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load TikTok Post.</p><p>The Bravo star said he "had been drinking" at the time and just casually declined the offer, telling Oshry that he "couldn't do that to Tom Schwartz." He added that owning a bar is "a lot of work" and "a lot of pressure."</p><p>After Oshry asked him if he "would not go into business or you would," Jax replied, "Not saying that," before jokingly bringing up a new bar idea.</p><p>"How funny would it be if I did ... Jax and James?" he said, referring to his former "Pump Rules" co-star, <a href=#><strong>James Kennedy</strong></a>. "What if we had our own [bar]?"</p><p>Jax went on to praise James, admitting that he is currently "100%" the "number one guy in the group."</p><p>Sandoval, 39, and Schwartz, 40, opened Schwartz & Sandy's in November 2022. They also co-own TomTom Restaurant & Bar.</p><p>After the news broke in March about Sandoval's months-long secret affair with <a href=#><strong>Raquel Leviss</strong></a> -- and his cheating on his girlfriend of nearly 10 years, <a href=#><strong>Ariana Madix</strong></a>, both bars were slammed with negative Yelp reviews. Schwartz -- Sandoval's longtime BFF and business partner -- <a href=#><strong>mentioned this to Ariana during the Season 10 finale</strong></a>, bringing up how her fans were trolling the two Toms' businesses following the scandal.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:65cd2a4d-e4dc-4de2-86d3-9ebb0d5a8fb7 data-container-ref=toofab:article:94453cf7-bbbc-4ce1-a5b4-5a160f3822ca data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d9/5by4/2023/05/04/d97fa6e0b30243ad9750912eab016fea_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jax Taylor Claims Randall Emmett Still Owes Him $75K: 'Where the F--- Is My Money?'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Meanwhile, elsewhere in his interview on "The Toast," Jax called out Sandoval for allegedly inviting his wife, <a href=#><strong>Brittany Cartwright</strong>,</a> to Tom Sandoval & The Most Extras concert recently.</p><p>"This is how tone-deaf and selfish [Sandoval] is," he said. "His band was performing in Louisville. He texted Brittany ... &nbsp;'Hey, if you have any friends in Louisville, [I would] love to see you. Come [see] my band. I'll get you free passes.'"</p><p>"I looked at the phone," Jax continued. "I go … 'Are you f---ing serious?'"</p><p>The podcast host said he was so angry he went off on Sandoval from his own phone.</p><p>"I went on my phone, and I go, 'Don't you ever f---ing text my wife again. How dare you. ... How selfish and tone-deaf are you? You do realize Brittany is friends with all these girls? What do you think she's going to do?'" Jax recalled, to which Oshry replied by describing Sandoval as a "true narcissist."</p><p>"It's like a serial killer who kills their family and then goes out to the bar," Jax joked.</p><p>When Oshry asked why Jax believed Sandoval would start a band when he's "not a talented singer," Jax -- who agreed with Oshry's assessment of Sandoval's talent -- replied, "I think it's kind of one of his lifelong dreams."</p><p>"He wants to be a rockstar, that's just who he is, that's just who he wants to be," he continued, adding, "You should have dreams and goals and whatever, but keep it in your living room. ... It's bad."</p><a id=gallery-link-2ba5cd67-608d-4462-8e60-406e714e2a1b class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:2ba5cd67-608d-4462-8e60-406e714e2a1b data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:94453cf7-bbbc-4ce1-a5b4-5a160f3822ca data-gallery-layout=list><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e6/4by3/2023/03/06/e6c42ba364a84997bd59e2b04f8ef053_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j29maXFfn665edOasKWnomKwra3Ipqpmq5OdxKK%2B07NkmqaUYsCiusOyqmavkaPBtHnTqGSgnaRiv6qwjKidZquRo7GwwsClZLCZo2KutLfEnWSinl2dsm7DwKernpxdqbxutc2vnKysXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
