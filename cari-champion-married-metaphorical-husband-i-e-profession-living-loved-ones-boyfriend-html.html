The job she did in West Virginia became an impressive part of her life. She shared about the difficulties she faced during those days in an interview with Tennis View magazine. She said,</p><p style=text-align:justify>"I was a one-man-band carrying a camera and a tripod and that was God-awful. But I loved it because I wanted to do it. I always wanted to be a reporter."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>After working for the media like Orange Country News channel in Santa Ana and WPTV-TV in West Palm Beach, Cari Joined WGCL-TV in Atlanta. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Read Also:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Cynthia Frelund Bio: Hottest NFL Reporter's Salary To Married Status</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Cari rose to prominence after working as a host for the channel. However, in November 2007, Cari was fired from the channel in the charge of uttering offensive words while on&nbsp;air.</p><p style=text-align:justify>But Cari dispelled the accusation and told that the microphone accidentally picked up the conversation that was addressed to the unhandy screenwriter. She said, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>"I called the screenwriter a 'mothersucka' not the f-bomb."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Later, in 2008, when it was proved that Cari was charged with groundless allegations, she was re-hired in WGCL-TV.

She confessed to the Tennis View Mag (mentioned on Aug 3, 2011, article) about her newly developed love towards tennis. She said,</p><p style=text-align:justify>“I absolutely love tennis. Here’s the funny thing about me: as a kid I had no coordination, and I tried all these different sports, every sport, and I couldn’t get it together. It wasn’t until I became an adult that my coordination came together, I covered a lot of tennis, especially the Williams sisters, and they made me love the sport even more. They opened the door to tennis for so many different people.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>Following the temptation, Cari auditioned for the Tennis Channel and got selected among fifty candidates. She joined the channel in 2009 and worked as a courtside reporter. Cari left Tennis Channel two years later and moved to ESPN in 2012 which was a step further in her career. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>More ESPN Crews:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>ESPN's Jay Williams & Wife First Baby Daughter, Amelia Is Extra Significant</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>She entered ESPN network as a host of ESPN2’s live debate show “First Take”.
