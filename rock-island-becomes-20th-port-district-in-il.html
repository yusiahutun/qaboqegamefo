Now the real work is ahead of us to work on identifying projects throughout the city, not just along the river and applying for state and federal grants.”</p><p>The bill says that Rock Island Regional Port District Board members will consist of the Rock Island City Council.</p><p>“The Mississippi River has always been a unique advantage in our region’s transportation infrastructure,” Rep. Johnson said. “Establishing the Port District allows us to use that advantage to create jobs, grow our economy and protect our vital natural resources.”</p><p>“This is great news for the Quad Cities,” said Chris Smith, operations director for Corn Belt Ports. “The passage of Rock Island Regional Port District legislation with strong bipartisan support in both the House and Senate sends a clear message of the importance of this area to regional and national supply chains. It also further demonstrates the need and supports initiatives for federal and state investment in the region. This was the only stretch of inland water in Illinois that has an interstate crossing but not a state recognized port.”</p><p>The Corn Belt Ports are comprised of the Illinois Waterway Ports and Terminals, the Mid-America Port Commission and the Mississippi River Ports of Eastern Iowa and Western Illinois.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaKmom5titrS4wKebZpqVmLyusdJmaWmsmGK9sL7TZpuiq6SntqTAjKKlZqGcZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
