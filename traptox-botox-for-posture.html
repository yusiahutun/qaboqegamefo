In the professional literature published on the use of neurotoxins for postural purposes, the most common muscle targeted is the trapezius muscle (also known as the ‘trap’). “This treatment is often referred to as ‘TrapTox’ or ‘Trap Botox’ on various social media platforms,” confirms Dr Soni.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But what exactly does the treatment involve?</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What is ‘TrapTox’, and how is it used for posture?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To explain the procedure simply, “you treat the neck and the shoulder muscles, which in turn makes you stand up straighter as it becomes harder to remain slouching,” explains one of London's leading aesthetic doctors and founder of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://thelovelyclinic.co.uk/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Lovely Clinic" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Lovely Clinic</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/drsarahtonks data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dr. Sarah Tonks" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Dr. Sarah Tonks</a>, adding that it can also lead to a longer looking neck and more defined shoulders. “It’s not a new treatment, but not many people are aware of it” she says, revealing that “it’s much more popular in Asia where it is sought for a shoulder-slimming effect”. Here, the emphasis seems to be on posture, though, and its improvement for both tension-related pain and appearance.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Many of us are hunched over a computer for hours each day and are developing a worsening of posture alongside increasing neck and shoulder pain,” explains Dr Soni.

While it can reverse these behaviours and the associated discomfort, know that it’s not a magic cure for them. “It can be uncomfortable as it kicks in,” she cautions, “and when you try to slouch but can’t”.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As always with medical procedures, “you would need to get assessed by a very experienced provider who knows the musculoskeletal system in depth, and who can discuss the advantages and disadvantages of treatment,” advises Dr. Soni.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What are the alternatives to ‘TrapTox’ for posture?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Non-injectable methods that one could try would be to invest in a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/fitness-wellbeing/a29498314/reformer-pilates/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Pilates class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Pilates</a> and conditioning coach in order to help with poor posture or work-related issues in posture,” offers Dr. Soni.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We also recommend visiting a 'performance clinic' – like London's <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://clubhealth.uk/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Club Health" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Club Health</a> – to holistically treat poor posture with a plan combining clinical Pilates, physiotherapy, massage and mobility therapies.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwrsSarK2xX6K2r7CMm6adsV%2BWgXWAkXBucWhfqb%2BivNOor2aan6m8uXnFqKlmqJ%2Bowba%2BxGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
