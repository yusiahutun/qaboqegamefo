Isabella Rossellini has returned to modeling at age 65, and she couldn’t help but gush about her homecoming.
Back in 1982, Isabella was the highest paid model in the world when she was the face of Lancôme, but when she was in her 40s back in 1996, the brand let her go. But now, she’s jumping back into it to star beside her son, Roberto, in a fall 2017 campaign for Sies Marjan."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It’s so easy to wear,” Isabella confessed. “Now I put on an incredibly bright pink sweater with black pants. There is a real statement of joyfulness.”</p><p><a href=#>MUST SEE: Jude Law’s Daughter Iris Law Is All Grown up and Stunning in Her First Modeling Campaign!</a></p><p>In a recent interview, Isabella reflected on her firing. “It was pretty rough, no doubt, it was hard,” she told <a href=#>The Guardian</a>. “My daughter was 10 and my son was one, and I was a single mom. I cried and was depressed, and I worried financially.”</p><p>Isabella has also confessed that she prefers modeling to acting. “[Modeling] gave me the confidence to act. Both my parents were very famous, so I was hesitant, but modeling gave me the feeling that I could dare,” she said.</p><p><a href=#>MORE: Christie Brinkley’s Daughter Sailor Brinkley Cook Admits It’s Hard to Be Compared to Her Model Mom</a></p><p>Today, Isabella realizes she’s looked at differently in the industry now that she’s older. “When you’re young, there is so much pressure, because you work, you need money. As you grow older, the focus becomes clearer and clearer, if you like. Nobody ever talks about that, how wonderful it is to grow older. They always talk about wrinkles, but aging is interesting, wrinkles or no wrinkles.” If one thing’s for sure, we’re so glad to see that Isabella is continuing her dream after all these years!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46iqpqalaG5onnRqKqsnZyhtq%2B1jKamnZ2cnruoecKopJ6akZi4bn2Scmhwbl8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
