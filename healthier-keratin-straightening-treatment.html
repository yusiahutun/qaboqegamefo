My journey began when I volunteered as tribute to undergo Goldwell's Kerasilk Control Keratin Treatment, a hair straightening process that&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;contain formaldehyde, unlike so many other options out there. I won't lie: The idea of saying goodbye to my 3A curls for three to five months tugged at my heart, but the appeal of getting a long-term, lower-maintenance hairstyle without the sketchy ingredients was too appealing to pass up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the past, the only time I&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>straightened my curls</a>&nbsp;was for long weekends or trips to dry climates when I knew it would be easier to manage than my voluminous waves. Also, I'll admit that I've secretly wanted smooth, straight hair since I first witnessed the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Anne Hathaway</a>&nbsp;makeover montage in&nbsp;Princess Diaries&nbsp;back in 2001 — and even Carrie Bradshaw wore her hair straight every now and again. Not to mention, just because I would undergo a chemical process to straighten my curls didn't mean they would be gone forever. I was assured multiple times they would (eventually) grow back post-treatment. However, before I got started, I had some questions. Luckily, my stylist,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Meri Kate O'Connor</a>&nbsp;(bless her and her patience), was able to help me out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep scrolling to learn everything about a keratin hair straightening treatment.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-a-keratin-treatment></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is a Keratin Treatment?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The treatment I received is the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Kerasilk Control Smoothing Service</a>. Essentially, it involves applying a solution with high concentrations of keratin to twice-washed hair. The keratin seeps down into hair's pores and is heat-sealed with a flat iron, leaving you with smooth, straight tresses. The downside? This specific treatment is only available at Goldwell salons, so you'll have to do your research.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-benefits-of-a-keratin-treatment></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Benefits of a Keratin Treatment</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The process promises straight hair with minimal maintenance, but the benefits don't stop there:</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Works on all hair types:</strong>&nbsp;The treatment will still eliminate the frizz/flyaways and stray&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cowlicks</a>. Think of it as a constant blowout without the barrel-curled ends or the complimentary champagne.</li><li><strong>Has restorative properties:</strong>&nbsp;According to O'Connor, the Kerasilk Control Smoothing Service can improve the texture and condition of color-treated hair to some extent. Virgin hair — like mine — works best, as it's able to absorb more of the keratin.</li><li><strong>Formaldehyde-free:</strong>&nbsp;Unlike a&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>traditional Brazilian blowout</a>, the Kerasilk Control treatment does not — repeat,&nbsp;not&nbsp;— use formaldehyde. That said, is this completely chemical-free? No. The keratin formula does have other chemicals in it, though not the kind used to preserve dead animals.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-consider></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Consider</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are two components to the treatment. The first&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>eliminates the frizz</a>&nbsp;(this is called the Shape Medium), and there are two options for the second component: You can either eliminate curls completely (Smooth Intense) or just tame the wave/curl (Smooth Medium). Because I wanted a dramatic change to post on Instagram, I opted for the Smooth Intense.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once you select the second option, it is mixed in equal parts with the Shape Medium and applied to the hair. If you want to keep a slight curl, opt for the Smooth Medium to keep some of your waves intact. I received the Shape Medium/Smooth Intense treatment.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-keratin-treatment-process></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Keratin Treatment Process</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The treatment took a little over three hours from start to finish. However, keep in mind that this will vary depending on your hair type and how much of it you have. If you have the kind of&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>heavy, thick mane</a>&nbsp;that results in a ponytail tension headache after two hours in an updo (guilty), it will take hours. I would recommend clearing your schedule and throwing an extra book and your phone charger in your bag. O'Connor noted that the process might take a bit longer with fine hair because it requires going over the sections with a flat iron a few extra times. Here's a complete breakdown of the steps:</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>1. Double Shampoo and Blow-Dry</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The process begins with a double shampoo to completely strip away dirt, oil, grime, or products. Next, my hair was blown dry (the stylist used an assistant to speed the process up a bit — and I have to say I've never felt more pampered than having two women working in tandem with blow dryers).</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>2. Apply Treatment and Wait</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After my hair was 80 percent dried, O'Connor sectioned my hair into three parts and began applying the treatment itself — a 1:1 ratio of Shape Medium (to control frizz) and the Smooth Intense (to straighten the curl). After painting the mixture onto my entire head, the solution was left to sit for 15 minutes.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>3. Blow-Dry (Again)</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Then came the fun part. O'Connor blow-dried my hair while the solution (which felt like a&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>leave-in conditioner</a>) was still in it, using a wide, ventilated paddle brush to do so. Given the thick consistency of the product, it took quite a bit of time.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>4. Flat Iron</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Afterward, she used a flat iron at 450 degrees Fahrenheit to flatten my curls into oblivion. Starting at the nape of the neck, she took sections about two to three inches wide and ironed them several times. This process — the aforementioned thermal activation process — is the most important part of the entire service. An interesting side note: The flat ironing resulted in big puffs of white steam, and my black cape was soon covered in white flakes of product, which I was assured was normal. The process was not otherwise uncomfortable (not even tingly).</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>5. Shampoo, Seal, and Blow-Dry</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After it was dried and straightened, I was shampooed once more to wash out the solution. Finally, O'Connor followed up with a sealant and&nbsp;another&nbsp;blow-dry, but this one took just 15 minutes — a welcome change from my usual 45-minute blowouts. Having had curly hair since puberty, I have to admit it was shocking to watch her just use her fingers while shaking the blow dryer back and forth across my scalp rather than a round brush and a downward motion. Once the hair was completely dry, it hung straight from the scalp with no need for touch-ups. The texture was smooth and silky, and you bet I spent the entire evening running my hands through it like I was&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Selena Gomez</a>&nbsp;in a Pantene commercial.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-results></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Results</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Savanna Ruedy</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>David Urbanke</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-cost></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Cost</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The keratin treatment runs anywhere from $350 to $600, depending on hair length. (Disclaimer: My service was complimentary for the purpose of this article).</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-aftercare></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Aftercare</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following the treatment, O'Connor told me I could even go home and wash my hair if I wanted. Four shampoos in a day felt a bit much for me, but I did take a dip in a pool the following weekend. Not only did my hair not curl, but after driving across the Verrazano Bridge — connecting Brooklyn and Staten Island in New York — with all of the car windows down, my hair&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>air-dried</a>&nbsp;perfectly straight, and I was able to finger comb out the tiny tangles. It's the closest I've come to witnessing a miracle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for upkeep? Nada. Zilch. Zero. I continued to wash my hair with the prescribed Kerasilk Control Shampoo and Conditioner (about three to four times a week) and let it air-dry. Styling products and heat weren't necessary. I could go from shower to subway to work in an hour, and in two hours, my hair was completely air-dried to reveal silky-smooth tresses. Although a bit of the curl came through, it appeared as a natural wave rather than a random curly coil.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to O'Connor, the treatment would last about three to five months. She added that most people who have the treatment year-round will have it done every six months.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-bottom-line></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Bottom Line</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I didn't have to touch a hairdryer in the weeks after my treatment or purchase any other hair products. Also, I didn't have to worry about a little sweat activating any baby curls at my temples the way I previously had to whenever I straightened my hair. I do miss my curls (these before photos are making me nostalgic!), and I'll probably return to them once the treatment grows out, but as far as a no-maintenance hairstyle is concerned, this one's hard to beat.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faqs-520aef8c-98bc-4c6b-a31d-8afaf6cab503></span><h2 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__title>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content mntl-accordion js-accordion" readability=50><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=1 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Can a keratin treatment help hair grow?</span></p><p>Not necessarily.
