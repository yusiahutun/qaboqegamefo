Here's a closer look at the difference:"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

This is something she picked up from Dothraki culture and first mentioned back in Season 1 of the show. (You may recall an argument she had about it with her brother Viserys).</p><img alt="Statue, Sculpture, Classical sculpture, Art, Human, Stone carving, Monument, Fictional character, Mythology, " title="Statue, Sculpture, Classical sculpture, Art, Human, Stone carving, Monument, Fictional character, Mythology, " width=1000 height=500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-emilia-clarke-got-hair-2-1555525395.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">HBO</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But in the next shot, Dany's hair is totally different. Now her hair is pulled into a braided half-up bun—a regal style much more reminiscent of something Cersei Lannister or Sansa Stark would have worn in the first few seasons of Game of Thrones.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Sophie Turner Plays 'Game of Thrones or Runway' | Harper's BAZAAR" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/2018-sophie-turner-thumbnail-clean-1520563975.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This difference in hairstyle is likely just a mistake on the part of the showrunners. Did they accidentally switch actress Emilia Clarke to a wig meant for a later episode? Or if you're an optimist: perhaps this new bun hairstyle is an accidental spoiler. Could it be an indication that there are more battles to be won for Dany and Jon Snow? We'll have to wait until next week to see what Dany's hair looks like in Winterfell.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk11"></span><h5 class="css-13733z5 e1jtuqk13">All of Sansa Stark's Most Meaningful Hairstyles from 'Game of Thrones'</h5><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk10"></span><img alt="Hairstyle, Fashion, Fictional character, Long hair, Brown hair, Street fashion, Movie, Stole, Fur, Fur clothing, " src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/mac.h-cdn.co/assets/17/33/1_sansa-arya.jpg title="Hairstyle, Fashion, Fictional character, Long hair, Brown hair, Street fashion, Movie, Stole, Fur, Fur clothing, " width=980 height=490 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a5b794e4-ba0e-4527-9e9d-e98142b9fbef_1526586861.jpg alt="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" title="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Jenna Rosenstein is the Beauty Director at Harper's BAZAAR across both print and digital. While attending NYU, she held internships at Women’s Wear Daily, Bloomingdale’s, Harper’s BAZAAR, and Allure, the latter of which she parlayed into her first job as the Beauty Assistant. She left Allure three years later as the Senior Beauty Editor. She spent a few months at Refinery29 overseeing branded content in the same title, before finally landing back at BAZAAR to manage all beauty content. When she's not testing every lipstick known to mankind, getting zapped by new lasers, or interviewing experts and celebrities, you can find Rosenstein at home in New Jersey with her son, husband, and black cat named Maddie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqGZmad8on6Wam9qbWJrfKitzJ5kqJ5dqbWzu82eqmaoopq6qrHRnmSdmZWjsrPF0mafmqGiYrqqv9Oaop5n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
