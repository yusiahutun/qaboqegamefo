The US-Soviet Union Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty reached in 1987 prohibited developing and possessing land-based missiles with a range between 500km to 5,500km.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Washington has been developing new intermediate-range missiles since it withdrew from the INF Treaty in 2019, citing Moscow’s alleged violations of the agreement and amid China’s increasing military advancement in the Indo-Pacific region, most notably its missile forces.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to the Pentagon’s annual report on China’s military power published in October, the PLA Rocket Force is estimated to have 500 intermediate and 1,000 medium-range ballistic missiles with ranges between 1,000-5,500km, as well as 550 launchers for firing these weapon systems.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“China has a clear geographic advantage. It can deploy its missile arsenal across a larger swathe of land, and even its short-range missiles would be effective in a local conflict,” said Shaan Shaikh, deputy director and fellow for the Missile Defence Project at the Washington-based think tank Centre for Strategic and International Studies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The US military cannot afford to match China in regional missile capacity, but it can improve its posture by expanding strike options, minimising response times and improving resilience under fire, as these deployments do.”</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2024/02/02/clean-vers.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">03:03</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Taiwan simulates attack from mainland China as island’s military conscripts begin extended service</p><p>Taiwan simulates attack from mainland China as island’s military conscripts begin extended service</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Timothy Heath, a senior international defence researcher at the Rand Corporation, said the US Army fielded these systems to augment similar capabilities already operated by the American air force and navy, creating an increasingly difficult target problem for Chinese military planners, and improving the resilience of US forces within the theatre.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Without the US Army’s weapons, China could destroy much of the US Air Force’s capacity by bombing airfields on Okinawa. It could also use anti-ship missiles to keep US warships away,” Heath said. “But now China must also target countries that host US Army Typhon launchers.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Japan showing ‘obvious offensive characteristics’ with new missile unit, says PLA</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Heath stressed that these weapons were deployed to deter a Chinese invasion across the Taiwan Strait.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The SM-6 could be used to shoot down Chinese military aircraft flying over Taiwan, and the Tomahawk could be used to destroy Chinese warships that supported an amphibious invasion,” Heath said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelnyutcuiq5qqqWSus8DInKOeZ2Nngnl%2FkXBmrqtdq7amw8SdZLCZoqO2r7OMnJ%2BippFirqityKeqrWWdnrmqwMCrsGaZlKuur6%2FEppynrF2ewbR5z6WYp2WdmrGqwcxmqZqml5p6rrXSrKClnV2hrra6wqGcq6tdlsCqrQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
