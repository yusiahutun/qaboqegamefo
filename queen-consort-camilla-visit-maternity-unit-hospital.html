She was introduced to Vicki Cochrane, Divisional Director of Nursing and Midwifery, telling her: "Thank you very much for the work you are doing."

"You have to get people to talk about it," nodded Camilla.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9a03e18f3fc6-camilla-nurse-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e2sjZVNc6mU8 data-wc=8><strong>The royal met with hospital staff on Thursday</strong></p><p id=ewqM7FMSclaD data-wc=23>There was laughter as the Queen Consort recognised Isabelle Boyer, Chair of Trustees at the charity Safe Lives, of which she is patron.</p><p id=ePBe6fEx5-7g data-wc=33>Isabelle was there in her role as an infant feeding volunteer at the hospital and explained how she was able to pick up on signs of abuse while spending time with new parents.</p><p id=e88BdGGM-LED data-wc=23>In another ward, Camilla was introduced to staff from the emergency department, children’s services, legal services, the burns unit and the nursing team.</p><p id=eENr89FMnvc0 data-wc=34>"It's so nice to see everyone working together," she told them. She then went into a private room to meet women who have used the service, spending longer than planned listening to their stories.</p><p id=eez249kqMNIs data-wc=41>Her Majesty, who has been the patron of Safe Lives since 2020, then headed to the hospital's indoor garden to meet the charity's CEO Suzanne Jacob, and one of its "Pioneer" Trustees, Shana Begum, along with other staff and agency partners.</p><p id=eO5iv9xH4Wwu data-wc=28>Camilla cooed over Shana's three-week-old son Jeremy, who was born at the St Helens and Knowsley hospital in Merseyside. She asked Shana: "Does he always sleep this well?"</p><p id=emJS5HKcy4-7 data-wc=45>"Not at night!" she replied, as the royal visitor stroked her son's tiny head. Told she had three older children aged 18, nine and seven, the Her Majesty asked: "Four?! Is he your last? Life has changed and you have got him to prove it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b0c17272f57f-queen-camilla-walking-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=esSIbBqz8779 data-wc=11><strong>This was her first official solo engagement in her new role</strong></p><p id=el0OefvUT98x data-wc=47>"It's so wonderful when you see people coming back into the system to help others. What a journey." Shana 38, survived 25 years of domestic violence. She grew up amid domestic abuse and was forced into marriage aged 17, later fleeing while pregnant with her first child.</p><p id=eLkBlDkCalX5 data-wc=33>Her father attempted to take her life in an act of honour-based violence and she later found herself in another abusive marriage, but managed to leave with her three eldest children in 2018.</p><p id=emqFtAFvn5Kz data-wc=50>She now works to raise awareness of domestic abuse and to support other survivors. As they chatted over a cup of tea, the Queen Consort said of Jeremy, "He has had an adventure."&nbsp;And as he started to grumble, she said: “Oh dear. That’s when the face gets all scrunched.</p><p id=eLkpAmBXUqJS data-wc=67>"Baby Jeremy, you are going to be a bit of a star. First photographs at a very early age, only three weeks old!” She told Shana: "You are doing a wonderful job. It's very important to have people like you." As little Jeremy began to squeal, she said, consolingly, "It's all too much. It's a big moment for him with cameras and people all over the place.”</p><p id=ekaylymFhlsR data-wc=28>Her Majesty, in a navy dress with white top stitching by Anna Valentine, appeared to have a bandaged right foot. Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the injury.</p><p id=e6wq2WcgNP6k data-wc=22>Her Majesty also spoke to Nicole Jacobs, Domestic Abuse Commissioner for England and Wales, along with other team members and agency partners.</p><p id=eD5VIKbgV22X data-wc=30>She said of the hospital's approach to domestic abuse: "I can see what a huge support system there is. "Just seeing how it works here, it's about getting everyone together."</p><p id=eIjAO22iW2-s data-wc=43>Speaking afterwards, Suzanne said of the Queen Consort's visit: "It's an extraordinary sign of her commitment and it will mean a huge amount to survivors and people who are still in abusive relationships up and down the country and all over the world.</p><p id=ejUBCFq3KjsT data-wc=30>"Making that choice is an extraordinary vote of confidence in those individuals – to know that somebody with her kind of profile and platform has made it such a priority."</p><p id=e3jL8_RIZgNv data-wc=62>Suzanne said that she was inundated with messages from survivors after every royal engagement with the charity, saying: "There is always a wave of people contacting us to say how important it was to them. It shows the importance of their story and experience, when they've constantly been told by a perpetrator that nobody will believe them and nobody will help them.</p><p id=eHYxMwRda9YZ data-wc=8>"The Queen Consort counteracting that is hugely helpful."</p><p id=ekAWHDSNWqak data-wc=31></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
