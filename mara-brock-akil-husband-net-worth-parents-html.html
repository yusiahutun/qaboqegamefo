He took the chance and asked her out for a date to watch&nbsp;Wynton Marsalis perform, and then their story began.&nbsp;</p><p>Mara <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">admitted</a> that the night was when she fell in love with Salim. Subsequently, their relationship blossomed into a marriage. They had their nuptials in 1999 and have been together ever since. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Mara Brock Akil and Her Husband, Salim Akil (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Essence</a>)</strong></p><p>So, they have a reason to celebrate their loving bond time and again.

Whether it be maintaining boundaries for work,&nbsp;pampering the other one with some vacation time, or going on date nights, they're always looking out for each other. Salim said,</p><p>Whatever we need to do to maintain our friendship and relationship, we do.</p><p>Likewise, she has two other men that make her life full of love; her two sons. Of course, as a talented personality, she must have a lot of knowledge to impart to her children, but she revealed that they had taught her something valuable too. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"These two taught me how to truly love, and know how to prepare space for someone else to simply BE.
