While at the company, he led the development of ShuffleNet, a neural network that works efficiently on mobile devices, and Brain++, the company’s core AI productivity platform, among other breakthroughs, according to the website of Megvii Research, the unit that Sun established.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/14/3741cd93-d9ab-4cb9-8d8c-2ac468cf09be_9db134f0.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Prior to joining Megvii, Sun was with Microsoft Research for 13 years, starting as an associate researcher in Asia in 2003 and rising to become principal research manager and a partner in the US, according to a curriculum vitae on his personal website.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sun was named by MIT Technology Review on its Innovators under 35 list in 2010, and he was the recipient of a range of industry and academic awards. He also had 35 US patents to his name, 13 of which were registered internationally, most of them from his time at Microsoft.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Born in October 1976, Sun returned to China when he joined Megvii. In 2019, he also became dean of the College of Artificial Intelligence at Xian Jiaotong University, his alma mater.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sun’s tenure at Megvii covered some of its most tumultuous years. His death also comes just after the AI giant resumed its pursuit of a public listing on Shanghai’s Nasdaq-like Star Market last month, where it expected to raise 6 billion yuan (US$890 million), after its attempt to list in Hong Kong failed for reasons related to US sanctions.</p>Megvii was among dozens of Chinese companies that the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">US put on a trade blacklist in 2019</span></a> for what Washington said was its “human rights violations and abuses” against Uygurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in China’s western Xinjiang region. Megvii denied the accusations, but inclusion on the blacklist meant that international investment banks and other overseas investors were likely to eschew the initial public offering.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Tensorflow and PyTorch have a new competitor from China</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The company reported a net loss of 1.86 billion yuan in the first half of 2021, according to its prospectus, which listed Sun as a core technical talent of the company.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwaavx2iZop9dqbKktI6aqa2hk6GycH%2BQcWhvbWlksKm1zZ6qnmWRnnqotcCnq2allZzDqrXSZpqhoZWberSvyJ6lraGjqXq0wc1moaKZnmKxqrHSZpignV1pgm6%2F1J2bnqY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
