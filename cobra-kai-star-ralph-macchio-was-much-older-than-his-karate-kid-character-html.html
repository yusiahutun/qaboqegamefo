But the actor will always be known for his role as Daniel LaRusso, aka Daniel-san from The Karate Kid.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_68>Macchio starred in all three films of the original franchise — The Karate Kid (1984), The Karate Kid Part II (1986), and The Karate Kid Part III (1989). The first movie opened to strong critical acclaim, and it became one of the highest-grossing films of 1984. The film also earned Pat Morita — who played Daniel’s mentor, Mr. Miyagi — an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><h2>He’s reprising his iconic role after 30 years for ‘Cobra Kai’</h2><p id=par-4_36>After nearly 30 years, Macchio and Zabka reprised their Karate Kid roles for Cobra Kai. The series, which is now available on Netflix, picks up with their characters as adults and rekindles their infamous on-screen rivalry.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_26>In an interview with <a href=#>The Independent</a>, Macchio talked about the endurance of the original film. And he explained how new series revisits that same nostalgic vibe.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p>“The Karate Kid is just one of the films of that era, I guess Back to the Future would be the other, that really has stood the pop culture test of time,” he said. “As much as you have to sell the poster, people already know what the poster is; it’s warm and fuzzy – it’s like the best cheeseburger you ever had, and you get to taste it again.”</p><h2>Macchio was much older than his ‘The Karate Kid’ character</h2><p id=par-6_32>In The Karate Kid, Macchio’s character is a 17-year-old high school kid. But the actor was actually in his mid-twenties — 23 to be exact —&nbsp; when he appeared in the film.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_38>Macchio looked pretty young in the film, and he has always been pretty cognizant of his boyish features. In a 2016 interview with <a href=#>McCall</a>, Macchio noted that his youthful look keeps fans connected to his Karate Kid character.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_47>“The fact that I look quasi-young for my age, I always have sort of elongated that sort of connection,” the actor said. “But I think in a positive way. It’s something that will be connected to&nbsp;me forever, regardless of what other work and other things I do.”</p><p id=par-9_22>Seasons 1 and 2 of Cobra Kai are now streaming on Netflix, as are all three films of The Karate Kid franchise.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSwsK7RmmSkmZliwLWt0WapmqSgnXqurcKcn6KnXayutHnMrpqhZZ%2Bhsaa%2BjK2fmqZdnba0ecqaqZqslWK4qrCMnJ%2BaqpGYwaa%2BjaGrpqRf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
