Let us find out!</p><h2>Is Devon Bostick&nbsp;Gay?</h2><p>Bostick has often been termed&nbsp;'gay,' as he has done justice to some gayish roles in some of his projects. He has played a low-key gay character in the Netflix series "Okja," which&nbsp;had him wreathed with the speculations of him being gay off-screen as well. But what is the reality?</p><p>Also read about:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>terry-chen-gay-partner-net-worth.html</a></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Thus far, we cannot assume&nbsp;actor's sexual preferences, as&nbsp;he has yet to make a statement regarding it. All we can do is&nbsp;wait for&nbsp;Devon to comment on these rumors. But, we sure do know the actor is a strong ally of the queer community and decides to publically speak about their rights.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-180 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Devon Bostick's Tweet regarding gay marriage (source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>)</strong></p><p>However, he was rumored to&nbsp;be dating Alexandra Burman in the past, but no substantial grounds were revealed to justify the gossip that flooded.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Recently the actor has been quite expressive towards&nbsp;Dylan Gelula, an American actress who is best recognized for her role&nbsp;in Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.</p><p></p><p><strong>Dylan Gelula's picture&nbsp;uploaded by Devon Bostick (source:<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Instagram</a>)</strong> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He had posted a picture of Dylan on January 5th, 2022, with the caption, "This is @dylangelula - she who won’t stop buying farms to turn them into her own “personal golf course” - she must be stopped, please call her reps." So another rumor and constant question surrounds the duo.&nbsp;</p><p>Are Dylan&nbsp;and Devon&nbsp;dating? To answer that question, all we can say is "we hope so", as there has been no legit evidence of the duo being&nbsp;romantic partners.&nbsp;All we can do now is wait for the duo to address the situation.</p><p>Moreover, him&nbsp;revealing about having a girlfriend now in his life would have smacked those rumors down, but Devon is nowhere found talking&nbsp;on the matter. Despite the fact that he keeps his lips tightly locked,&nbsp;he has always been socially verbal and flirtatious regarding his past dating relationships.</p><p>Now that we know Devon does not like speaking about his romantic life much, let's take a look at his successful career and more about him.</p><h2>Short Bio</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Born as Devon Bostick on&nbsp;November 13, 1991.&nbsp;Devon is an actor and a producer. Standing at the height of 5’10 and at the age of 30 his parents are also known in the entertainment industry, Devon's mother, Stephanie Gorin is a casting director and his father Joe Bostick, is an actor.</p><p>Also, there was a small situation where&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>actor Charlie Wright replaced Devon as Rodrick</a>&nbsp;which&nbsp;the fans were not pleased about and hated it. Now deleted&nbsp;trailer for&nbsp;"Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul" received&nbsp;11,300 dislikes as compared to the 1,800 likes just after ten days of release. The trailer got officially released on&nbsp;March 16, 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>Several videos were made criticizing the fact, and Devon, too reacted to the trailer.
