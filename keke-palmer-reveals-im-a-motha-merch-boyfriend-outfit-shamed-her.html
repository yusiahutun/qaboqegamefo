"One thing is certain and one thing is true," she wrote on <a href=#><strong>Twitter</strong></a>. "I'M A MOTHER, through and through!"</p><p>She then unveiled a very nice white crewneck to her <a href=#><strong>storefront</strong></a> with the phrase "I'm a Mother" emblazoned proudly across the front. "To all my moms out there, how did your baby change you?" she asked. "Mine empowered me! On such another level, my perspective changed because when my baby is good I'm GREAT! Look at that face! Gratitude galore."</p><p>Jackson hasn't responded to the latest blow by Palmer, but that could be because he deleted his Twitter account after his attempt to double-down on his stance led to an even bigger blowback.</p><p>In the since-deleted followup, Jackson wrote, "We live in a generation where a man of the family doesn't want the wife & mother to his kids to showcase booty cheeks to please others & he gets told how much of a hater he is."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:65d439a9-6cbd-4585-bb94-613c9e50e113 data-container-ref=toofab:article:b55bf20b-75ff-4466-9fe6-eeb760fee251 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/cb/5by4/2023/04/08/cb454304145f400ba35f57070d2997aa_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Keke Palmer Celebrates Postpartum Body, Thanks Baby For Giving Her Curves</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>He concluded, "This is my family & my representation. I have standards & morals to what I believe. I rest my case."</p><p>Before this latest product launch, Palmer appeared to initially respond to Jackson's tweets by doubling down herself, sharing <a href=#><strong>even more pictures</strong></a> of her amazing night with Usher.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>"I wish I had taken more pictures but we were running late! I am telling y'all right now, if you haven't seen [Usher] YOU MUST GO!! HE WAS SO FABULOUS!!" she captioned the photos. "Giving theater, Atlanta downnn, tips and tricks and just absolutely iconic. I was truly inspired as a performer. I whooped some ass in spades too! Where is that pic of us all together with the King himself??"</p><p>In the comments, Usher wrote, "The Big Boss!! Thank U for coming üôèüèæ," while Jameela Jamil praised her dress. Jenni "JWoww" Farley also said she looked hot, Sheree Whitfield commented she was "Flawless in this black number" and Hacks star Hannah Eibinder added, "stunning poised elegant gorgeous perfect."</p><p>You can check out some of that initial fan reaction right here.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:319660d4-def2-4771-8857-b4e970f841ec data-container-ref=toofab:article:b55bf20b-75ff-4466-9fe6-eeb760fee251 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7f/5by4/2023/07/06/7fc48325673c43c2b038d986349d7809_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram / Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Keke Palmer's Boyfriend Darius Jackson Roasted Online Following Outfit Outrage</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3BmaXFfoLKssYypmKWllad6s7HVnpilq12eum6tjKamraCRYrqmvsKhZJunqZu%2FqrHNnWSoraSbtrV50qGYpp2UYrWmvo4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
