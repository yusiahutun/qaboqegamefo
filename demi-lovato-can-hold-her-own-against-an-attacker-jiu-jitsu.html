Demi Lovato's been focusing on her mental, emotional and physical health since her near-fatal overdose last year -- and she feels confident she's strong enough to face anything and anyone that comes her way.

"Reality is, I'm sitting at the gym, post jiu-jitsu, feeling high on life and drinking my post-workout shake. I'm sweaty and not looking this glamorous right now, but f--k, I feel awesome. And posting this feels empowering because I like this pic where I feel sexy and I can also defend myself from anyone that ever tries to attack me. Any size, any shape, any gender."</p><p>"I have security, but in the moments I'm alone, I feel confident (no pun intended) that I can hold my own against an attacker," she continued. "I hope everyone finds something they become as passionate about as I feel about jiu-jitsu."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Demi was also feeling grateful for the people who've stuck by her side through her "darkest moments."</p><p>"Just me and my best friends living our best lives," she captioned another photo from Bora Bora, showing two friends (Sirah and Matthew) on either side of her. "Thank you for never leaving me in my darkest moments, for always drying my tears, even when they're from watching 'Moana.' Thank you for being loyal, honest and so grateful for every little thing...like crying because we swam with fish/sharks/stingrays and coral reef. I'm so lucky to be best friends with two incredible souls who are so talented and creative because it inspires me daily. And you're so supportive of me and every little thing I do."</p><p>"You've traveled across the country to visit me and [have] stayed with me at my house for days on end when I'm struggling to make sure I'm okay," she continued. "But most importantly, you never abandoned me like others did when I was going through shit. You were there to listen without judgement and only love, and I can never fully express what that means to me. You're the greatest friends I've EVER had, and our future together is so bright. I love you both more than you can imagine! Thank you for this past week. I'm both y'alls biggest fans."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Demi nearly lost her life on July 24, 2018, after suffering a drug overdose in her Hollywood Hills home. She was immediately treated with Narcan -- an emergency treatment for narcotic overdoses -- and transported to a Los Angeles hospital, where she was eventually stabilized.</p><p>She spent the remainder of last year out of the limelight and in treatment. She celebrated six months of sobriety on Jan. 25.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
