I’ve learned the hard way that acne doesn’t end once you turn 18. In fact, even though I had relatively clear skin growing up, my breakouts only seemed to get worse as I got older. It’s not even my face that’s usually the issue — it’s the skin on my neck, chest, and back that can be especially temperamental."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It’s not even my face that’s usually the issue — it’s the skin on my neck, chest, and back that can be especially temperamental. A nice day at the beach, a mild workout, or even falling asleep with my sweatshirt on all hold the risk of me being covered in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pimples or tiny little whiteheads</a>, which seem to pop up by the hundreds.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kentucky-derby-2.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/buffing-bar.jpg><p>I’ve seen over a dozen dermatologists for my skin issue, and pretty much all of them have said the same thing: it’s folliculitis. Those microscopic hair follicles, which everyone has all over their bodies, are becoming inflamed and infected, probably brought on by sweat. And even though I’ve resorted to showering twice a day and have been on and off steroid creams for years, I’ve never found a true, long-term, or easy solution. Until I discovered <a data-pmc-sp-product=7abd9907ac452df7ec3401438cf9a99a href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Topicals High Roller Ingrown Hair Tonic","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Topicals High Roller Ingrown Hair Serum | Roll-on Tonic to Soothe and Calm Irritated Skin on Face, Armpits and Bikini Areas | Contains Salicylic and Glycolic Acid | Vegan and Cruelty-Free (1.7 Fl Oz)","price":"26.00","id":"B0BR4S8FLT","category":"Facial Peels"},"id":1650182,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Topicals High Roller Ingrown Hair Tonic</a> .</p><p>It was after a particularly rough period of <a href=# id=auto-tag_pimples data-tag=pimples>pimples</a> that I began frantically searching TikTok for body acne treatment and came across <a rel=nofollow href=#>a video</a> recommending this miracle product. I will admit that the clip offered limited information, but I was desperate and chose blindly trust the creator, quickly ordering the roller off of <a href=# id=auto-tag_amazon data-tag=amazon>Amazon</a>. I’m not kidding when I say that it worked almost immediately, healing one of the worst breakouts of my life and giving me clear skin within two days.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Topicals-High-Roller-Ingrown-Hair-Tonic-with-Salicylic-Acid-AHAs-and-BHAs-For-Razor-Bumps-Irritation-and-Ingrown-Hairs-1.jpg><p>Topicals High Roller Ingrown Hair Tonic</p><p>On Sale 23% off</p><p><a data-pmc-sp-product=7abd9907ac452df7ec3401438cf9a99a href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Topicals High Roller Ingrown Hair Tonic","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Topicals High Roller Ingrown Hair Serum | Roll-on Tonic to Soothe and Calm Irritated Skin on Face, Armpits and Bikini Areas | Contains Salicylic and Glycolic Acid | Vegan and Cruelty-Free (1.7 Fl Oz)","price":"26.00","id":"B0BR4S8FLT","category":"Facial Peels"},"id":1650182,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Topicals High Roller Ingrown Hair Tonic</a> won’t dry you out, either.

Another key factor are the active ingredients inside this blue tube. Glycolic acid, salicylic acid, Zinc PCA, and niacinamide won’t just calm folliculitis, but can also help with ingrown hairs and razor burn, just as the name promises.</p><p>“I use for my underarms, since I started waxing,” one Amazon customer wrote in their review. “I haven’t had an ingrown hair since and my dark spots are going away. Waxing has somehow given me ingrown hairs so I invested in this, I was not disappointed.”</p><p>Now, I no longer panic whenever I see a group of pimples pop up. I’ve used this all over my body as well as my face, and have even let my husband try it out, adding another happy customer to the mix. While the $26 price tag might make people hesitate before buying, the roller is currently on sale for <a href=#>Amazon Prime Big Deal Day</a>, saving you 20%. However, even if it were $50 I’d add to cart — it’s that good, and I’m actually mad I didn’t find it sooner.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1mmpqqlWR%2Bd4GPam9rZ6SkvaqvwKWqZqCZnLVuvs6lo56qXZ67qL7OsKVmoJGev27AzqegnGWimsOqsdZo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
