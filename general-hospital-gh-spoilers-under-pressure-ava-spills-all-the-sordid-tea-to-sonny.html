The new nanny, Betty Rutherford (Ella Lentini) who Mason Gatlin (Nathanyael Gray) hired to replace Pilar Rodriguez (Brenda Barbarena) presents some decided problems.</p><h3>General Hospital Spoilers – Making Threats</h3><p>As Ava is first talking to Betty, she seems perfect for Mason’s purposes, at least; the whole idea of replacing Avery Jerome-Corinthos’ (Ava and Grace Scarola) nanny was to gather intel. Pilar was very loyal to Sonny, having worked for his family before caring for Avery, and Ava tells Betty that Sonny could be fooled by her. Ava had been unable to get the intel on Pikeman that Mason wanted so the idea of a new nanny came up.</p><p><a href=#>But Betty starts making threats against Ava’s mother</a>, Delia Ryan (Ilene Kristen) and everything soon starts going south between Betty and Ava. Ava knows that she’s going to have to tell Sonny what’s going on because she can’t trust Betty with Avery if she’s making threats toward Delia.</p><p><img alt="General Hospital: Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard)" width=800 height=566 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2023/07/general-hospital-gh-spoilers-under-pressure-ava-spills-all-the-sordid-tea-to-sonny/ data-jpibfi-post-title="General Hospital (GH) Spoilers: Under Pressure, Ava Spills All The Sordid Tea To Sonny?" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GH-Sonny-Corinthos-1.jpg></p><h3>General Hospital Updates – A Tense Argument Ensues</h3><p><a href=#>A tense argument ensues between the two women</a> over Betty’s threats, and who should walk in but Sonny, and interrupt it! Ava hasn’t wanted Sonny to know the trouble she’s been in and that has only continued to accumulate since hitting Nikolas Cassadine (Adam Huss) in the head with that gargoyle statuette. But the fewer people who know what really happened to Nikolas, the better-and there were hints in what Victor Cassadine (Charles Shaughnessy) left her that he knew. Ava decides the only way to get herself out of this mess and keep her daughter and her mother safe is to spill all the sordid tea to Sonny!</p><h3>Sonny Corinthos Suspicious</h3><p>Even though Sonny doesn’t hear much of the argument between Ava and Betty, he picks up on the strange vibe between the two women and he demands answers. He promises to help Ava if she tells him everything that’s going on and so she does, once Betty is out of earshot. Unfortunately, even though Sonny now knows everything about what happened to Nikolas and how Mason’s been shaking her down, she doesn’t divulge Betty’s threats toward Delia.</p><p>She probably should but she still needs a nanny for Avery and now she’s stuck with Betty. It’s driving Ava crazy but she feels like the power Mason has over her and anything he’s tasked Betty with other than babysitting is mitigated by Sonny taking care of Mason!</p><p>Be sure to catch up on everything happening with GH right now. <a href=#>Come back here often for General Hospital spoilers, news, and updates.</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo67Am7ClmaWjsbPFjZympmdiZX90e49wZqCdnpq%2ForiMoaasqJmprq15xqFkrKifnrmmvtJmrKeclad6sb7ErKquqpVirretjKynoqScqHqiuMtmq6GdXai8s7DInWStnZFiwbB50qilp7Ff</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
