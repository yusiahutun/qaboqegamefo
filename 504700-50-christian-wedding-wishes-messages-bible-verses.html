It serves to remind them of the importance of God in their lives and, importantly, in their <a href=#>marriage</a>. Here are some of the Christian wedding wishes with <a href=#>Bible</a> verses:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/68864eee1c52adff.jpg><ul><li>Love is patient; love is kind. It does not envy; it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, and it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, and always perseveres. Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 1 Corinthians 13:4-8</li><li>And now, these three remain faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love. 1 Corinthians 13:13</li><li>Do everything in love. 1 Corinthians 16:14</li><li>Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. Ephesians 4:2</li><li>Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers a multitude of sins. 1 Peter 4:8</li><li>There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love. We love because he first loved us. 1 John 4: 18-19</li><li>Hatred stirs up conflict, but love covers all wrongs. Proverbs 10:12</li><li>Whoever does not love does not know God because God is love. 1 John 4:8</li><li>Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good. Romans 12:9</li><li>Husbands love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her. Ephesians 5:25</li><li>However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband. Ephesians 5:33</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/37dbf3641d8d3026.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Steve Harvey Says Woman Is In Charge of The House: "Marriage Isn't 50-50"</span></p></a><h2>Christian wedding wishes for a friend</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/37dbf3641d8d3026.jpg><p class=align-left>Sending your friends or close acquaintances who are tying the knot Christian <a href=#>wedding wishes</a> can be tough.
