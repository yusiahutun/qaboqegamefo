For $16.95 per month, the brand offers an 8-milliliter sample of a fragrance, which should last you about 120 sprays. That’s just the beginning plan, too — you can opt for a multi-piece plan and get up to three samples for $37 per month. Bear in mind that some fragrances may be listed as “premium,” which means that you could get charged $5, $10, or $15 on top of your monthly plan.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With picks from niche and designer brands, Scentbird features an impressive library of over 600 scents, and you can choose what ships.

With ScentBox, you can potentially access over 1,000 fragrances, including niche brands. And while some services may make you choose between gendered selections, ScentBox doesn’t restrict your choices. Here’s another bonus: If you don’t love a scent, you’re eligible for up to five free exchange shipments in a 12-month period.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Your access to more expensive fragrances will depend on your plan. With the standard plan ($16.95 per month), you can choose from over 600 designer perfumes to get your 8-milliliter atomizer of the month. With plans that are premium ($21.95 per month) or platinum ($30.95 per month), you can browse even more fragrances from high-end and niche designers.

If you’re struggling with where to start, you can take Luxury Scent Box’s fragrance survey developed by specialists. After the survey, you’ll receive general recommendations from LUXSB’s library of over 550 scents. You can also retake the survey down the line just in case you find your taste evolving over the course of your subscription.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to the actual product you’re receiving, LUXSB doesn’t skimp. For $15.95 a month, you get 9 milliliters of a fragrance, which amounts to about 150 sprays per month. Plus, you get a new fragrance case every quarter. As for things to consider, keep in mind that you will only be able to pick out one fragrance per month. Additionally, you need to be subscribed for at least two months if you opt for a new subscription discount.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-affordable-perfumecom></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Most Affordable: Perfume.com</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-at-a-glance></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>At a Glance</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Starting Price: </strong>$14.95/month</li><li><strong>Sample Size: </strong>8 ml&nbsp;</li><li><strong>No. of Items Per Box:&nbsp;</strong>1<br></li></ul><span class="mntl-sc-block__list-heading mntl-sc-block-universal-comparison-list__list-heading">What We Love</span><ul class="mntl-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-universal-comparison-list__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>One of the lowest subscription prices available</p></li><li readability=0><p>You pick what ships, but fragrance experts can also recommend fragrances for you</p></li><li readability=0><p>Over 500 brands available, including both niche and designer fragrance houses</p></li></ul><span class="mntl-sc-block__list-heading mntl-sc-block-universal-comparison-list__list-heading">What We Don't Love</span> <span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-its-a-top-pick></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why It’s a Top Pick&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">Perfume.com</a>’s monthly subscription plan is only $14.95 a month for 8 milliliters of fragrance in a travel-sized atomizer. This price is often lower during the first month thanks to deals for first-time subscribers, so you can try out the service without paying a pretty penny. If you find fragrances that you absolutely adore, you may even track down full-sized bottles on Perfume.com for up to 80% off the retail price.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although Perfume.com offers an affordable perfume subscription, it’s a high-quality and trusted brand. In terms of variety, there are over 500 brands that you can choose from — think Prada, Guerlain, Cartier, and more. Each month, you get to pick which scent gets shipped. If you don’t choose a scent, Perfume.com’s fragrance experts will select a scent for you from the brand’s bestsellers.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One thing to consider is that you have to choose either a men’s or women’s subscription when you sign up, which could limit your options.

Skylar designs its perfumes without any of the 36 fragrance allergens known to cause allergies and asthma or the 1,300+ ingredients restricted by the EU. Additionally, it lists out its ingredients rather than just labeling them as “fragrance.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For $20 a month, Skylar Scent Club members receive a 10-milliliter rollerball with each shipment, plus perks like 20 percent off Skylar products and $20 per additional rollerball. The fragrance of the month will usually be available in limited quantities, so a subscription gives members exclusive access. Plus, the subscription is also relatively flexible; you can skip, swap, or add products without a fuss.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are just a few things to keep in mind. The $20 monthly price tag is steeper than other comparable perfume subscriptions, and you have to pay $4.95 for shipping. Additionally, you only get to test out Skylar products, so you can’t try scents from other brands.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plan-options-the-fragrance-club></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Best Plan Options: The Fragrance Club</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-at-a-glance></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>At a Glance</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Starting Price: </strong>$14.99/month</li><li><strong>Sample Size: </strong>10 ml</li><li><strong>No. of Items Per Box: </strong>1</li></ul><span class="mntl-sc-block__list-heading mntl-sc-block-universal-comparison-list__list-heading">What We Love</span><ul class="mntl-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-universal-comparison-list__list" readability=1.5><li readability=2><p>Three plans available, including monthly, bimonthly, and annual options</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Perfume sample size is relatively generous at 10 ml</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Listings break down notes so you know what to expect from scent</p></li></ul><span class="mntl-sc-block__list-heading mntl-sc-block-universal-comparison-list__list-heading">What We Don't Love</span> <span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-its-a-top-pick></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why It’s a Top Pick&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If plan variety is your top priority, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">The Fragrance Club</a> may be the best fragrance subscription box for you. With this service, you can choose between a monthly ($14.99 per month), bimonthly ($17.99 every two months), or annual plan ($149.88 per year). The monthly plan is great for most people to get a feel for the service before committing. If you casually enjoy perfume but don't want to stock up on too many scents or spend too much money, a bimonthly plan could be right for you. At the other end of the spectrum, an annual plan may be worth investing in if you’re an avid perfume enthusiast who wants the best savings and the most variety.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Each shipment comes with a 10-milliliter bottle of fragrance, which is a relatively generous amount of perfume when you consider other subscriptions at a similar price. The listings also break down the top, middle, and base notes for each scent, so you have an idea of what the fragrance will smell like. The catch is that The Fragrance Club has a fairly limited collection, as both its men’s and women’s collections have under 40 scents each. The site is also sparse, featuring an empty FAQ page that doesn’t provide much specific information.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-rare-scents-olfactif></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Best for Rare Scents: Olfactif</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-at-a-glance></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>At a Glance</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Starting Price: </strong>$20/month</li><li><strong>Sample Size: </strong>2 ml</li><li><strong>No. of Items Per Box: </strong>3 or 6<br></li></ul><span class="mntl-sc-block__list-heading mntl-sc-block-universal-comparison-list__list-heading">What We Love</span><ul class="mntl-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-universal-comparison-list__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>Unique niche fragrances that are different from mainstream department store picks</p></li><li readability=0><p>Receive a variety of scents per month, as opposed to just one sample</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Subscribers get membership perks such as discounts off on full bottles<br></p></li></ul><span class="mntl-sc-block__list-heading mntl-sc-block-universal-comparison-list__list-heading">What We Don't Love</span> <span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-its-a-top-pick></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why It’s a Top Pick&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Popular scents garner attraction for a reason, but sometimes, you just want something a little different. Featuring brands such as 4160 Tuesdays and Amouage, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">Olfactif</a> is ideal if you’re looking for niche fragrances that are more one-of-a-kind than mainstream department store picks.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With an Olfactif membership, you can receive three or six new scents in each monthly shipment. Here’s how the two plans break down: For $20 per month, you can get three scents per month with either the Men’s or Women’s plan. For $38 per month, you can get all six fragrances of the month from the Men’s and Women’s collections. An Olfactif membership also gives you a few discount perks, like full access to 20 percent off full bottles of featured scents, 10 percent off other full bottles, and 10 percent off à la carte samples.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One thing to consider is that the vials are small — you get 2 milliliters per vial, so you can’t spend very long getting to know each fragrance. Also, keep in mind that the collections are curated, so you can’t choose what you get unless you add on extra samples.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-final-verdict></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Final Verdict</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Offering something for anyone interested in fragrances, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="sid=${DOC_ID}-${REQUEST_ID}">Scentbird</a> is our pick for the best monthly perfume subscription.

Often, you can choose from different brands, which usually include designer, celebrity, and niche ones. Other times, the subscription service picks out a couple of fragrances of the month for you to sample. Olfactif, for example, provides recommendations for indie and high-end luxury brands. Some subscription boxes, such as Skylar Scent Club, also send out limited-edition perfumes from their own brand.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=2 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Do Perfume Subscription Boxes Come With Full Bottles?</span></p><p>Full-size perfume subscriptions are not common. In most cases, monthly perfume subscription boxes send samples in atomizers or rollerballs with eight to 10 milliliters of fragrance. After trying out a particular perfume, you may be able to get a full-size bottle (typically 30, 50, or 80 milliliters) with a membership discount.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=3><p><span class=accordion__title>Does Perfume Expire?</span></p><p>Perfumes last about two years,<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=10></span> but proper storage can help extend their shelf life. When you spray your perfume, air can get into the bottle and oxidize the fragrance. Oxidation can change the color of the fragrance, turning it a darker hue. It can also alter the smell and make it more sour or metallic. Perfumes with green, citrusy, patchouli, and fruity notes are particularly sensitive to oxidation, so you want to keep an eye out for these scents.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=4 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Where Should You Store Your Perfume?</span></p><p>Exposure to direct light, heat, and humidity can degrade a fragrance. To keep your perfume fresh, place it in a dark, cool, and dry space. If possible, it’s a good idea to store your fragrance in its original box to protect it even further.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=9></span> Additionally, remember to recap your perfume after every use to limit its exposure to oxygen.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=5 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How Can You Make Your Perfume Scent Last Longer?</span></p><p>One way to make your perfume scent last longer throughout the day is by spraying your pulse points on your wrists, inside your elbows, behind your ears, behind your knees, and on the nape of your neck. These areas give off heat and can make your fragrance develop faster. It also helps to spray on moisturized skin, as fragrance sticks onto moisturized skin better than dry skin.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=11></span>&nbsp;</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-researched></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Researched</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><br>We reviewed more than a dozen perfume subscriptions to find the best ones for different types of customers.
