During the 10 days, the couples can decide if they want to get engaged—still sight unseen. After the proposal, the couples meet face-to-face for the first time and go on vacation at a resort in Mexico, where they learn more about each other and meet the other couples. After the trip, the couples, who all live in the same city, return to the real world and move into an apartment together as they meet each other’s families and friends and prepare for their weddings. At the altar on their wedding days, the couples must decide whether to marry or breakup as they answer the age-old question of if love can be truly blind.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>Since the premiere of <a href=# rel=noopener>Love Is Blind</a>, the show has become one of Netflix’s highest-rated series, with more than 30 million views in its first two months. “Across the world, everybody feels the same way: Everyone wants to be loved for who they are on the inside. It doesn’t matter where you live, what you look like, how old you are, what your background is, which class you know, or social structure you feel like you’re a part of, everyone wants to be loved for who they are,” creator Chris Coelen told Variety in 2020. “In today’s society we’ve got all these ways to find love through dating apps and technology. Those things sort of counterintuitively have made people feel disposable. They’ve made people feel like it’s all surface level. It does the opposite thing it was supposed to do. So we thought, what if we took everybody’s devices away, how could we get them to focus on connecting with other people?”</p><p>Coelen also told <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> about how&nbsp;the connections on <a href=# rel=noopener>Love Is Blind</a> were based on choice, which is why the relationships were that much stronger. “It was incredibly scary because nobody had to do anything, versus a show like we do Married at First Sight, you sign up and you know, you’re getting married to a stranger. Here, nobody had to do anything. It was if you find someone, if you choose. Which is so scary. They don’t have to go through with the wedding ceremony,” he said. “But assuming they found someone, could that love overcome any judgment in the real world? That’s an incredibly fascinating question. And that’s what we set out to try to examine.”</p><p>But back to Love Is Blind season 4.

The answer is no. Zack Goytowski and Irina Solomonova met and got engaged in The Pods on Love Is Blind season 4, but broke up at the end of their vacation in Mexico at the end of in episode 5 after they both realized their relationship wasn’t working.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Today</a> in March 2023, Irina explained why she and Zack broke up. “I feel like me and Zack weren’t meant to be,” Irina said. “It wasn’t anything about his looks, or anything like that, it was more of the sense of feeling this gut feeling that he wasn’t the person for me.” Zack also confirmed to Today that he and Irina haven’t spoken since their breakup. “I have not talked to Irina since Mexico. She sent me text messages, but I honestly never responded any of them,” he said.</p><p>Irina also responded to criticism over how she treated Zack during their relationship on Love Is Blind season 4 in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in March 2023.&nbsp;“From a communication [standpoint], I do feel like I was myself during the whole show. But I think there was moments where I wasn’t my best self, and I am excited to watch it and see all the new perspectives and learn from whatever is not my character,” Irina said. “Obviously, we’re being recorded all day, and there’s going to be moments where I’m not my best self. But I’m excited to see how everything came out and just to grow from everything and put my best foot forward.” She continued, “I have truly no bad intentions for anybody at all. So I’m excited to clean things up if there is anything.”</p><p>Irina also told People that she didn’t “regret choosing” Zack on Love Is Blind season 4. “I think that Zack was one of the best people I had a connection with in the pods,” she said. “We connected a lot about our families and trauma and life in general.” Irina also explained that there wasn’t one “specific” reason she and Zack broke up.&nbsp;“I don’t think there was a specific moment. I would just think it was a lot of things,” she said. “It was like maybe little mannerisms he did or maybe singing, but there was just something inside of me that I was like, ‘This isn’t the person for me.'”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=are-micah-and-paul-still-together-from-love-is-blind-season-4>Are Micah and Paul still together from Love Is Blind season 4?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Micah-Paul-Love-Is-Blind-Season-4.png><p><strong>Relationship status</strong>: Broken up</p><p>Are Micah and Paul still together from Love Is Blind season 4? The answer seems to be no. Micah Lussier and Paul Peden were not one of three couples who got married in the Love Is Blind season 4 finale. Public court records from King County, Washington, where Seattle is located and Love Is Blind season 4 was filmed, also confirmed this. According to King County’s official records search, Micah and Paul—like each engaged couple from Love Is Blind season 4—received their marriage application on May 2, 2022, but did not obtain a marriage certificate, which confirms they did not get married. The application listed the grantor as “Micah Marie Lussier” and the grantee as “Paul Hal Peden.”</p><p>Micah and Paul confirmed they were not still together during the Love Is Blind Season 4 “After the Altar” special, which saw Paul dating his new girlfriend, Geneva Dunham. TikTok user @<a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#>kathryn.7.7</a> claimed in a video in March 2023 that she met Micah and Paul while they were filming the Love Is Blind season 4 “After the Altar” special, where they were seen kissing, which seemed to hint that they were dating but not married. “I did meet Micah and Paul just under a year ago. May of 2022 out in Scottsdale, Arizona, where I live. She lives in the same apartment complex as a friend of mine. We saw these two at the pool all over each other, making out. And she decided to introduce herself to myself and her friend,” the user said.</p><p>The user then shared a photo of Micah and Paul in the pool. “Here’s a picture of that day. That’s Micah and Paul. The date says May 28, 2022, at 5:19 p.m. They were just in the pool, all over each other, and when she introduced herself, she did mention to me&nbsp; and my friend pretty much right away, they weren’t really together but they were forced to be because it was the ‘After’ part of a show. I asked her what show, and she said she really wasn’t supposed to say anything, but told us it’s a reality show on Netflix. She would be on one of the upcoming seasons and it was a show where you meet someone and the intention is to falling in love without seeing the other person. Obviously, we know what that is. It’s Love Is Blind.” In another <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">video</a>, the user claimed that both Micah told her that she and Paul weren’t officially dating but “had” to be together because of Love Is Blind. “She was just a girl basically saying that she didn’t know other people at the pool and she was bored and really not feeling it with the guy she was with, so as I would ask anybody shoe said that to me, I just asked her, ‘So why are you here with him?’ and that’s what prompted her to tell us the rest that I already stated in the last video about the reality show,” she said.</p><p>The user also added that she was confused that Micah and Paul were kissing but told her that they didn’t want to be together. “Those of you pointing out, why would they be making out one minute and saying they don’t want to be together the next minute, I’m equally as confused as you, I was that day as well,” she said. “I even said that to my friend who I was with. Clearly, there’s something weird here because they are making out and all over each other one minute and then she’s over here talking us while he’s talking to some of the guys saying that she’s really not that into it.”</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">E! News</a> after the Love Is Blind season 4 reunion, Paul confirmed that he and Micah dated after their wedding but broke up again soon after due to the distance. Paul lives in Seattle, Washington, while Micah splits her time between there and Scottsdale, Arizona. “I still retained that hope. Going into it, I was like, ‘Maybe we’re not there now, but that doesn’t mean we can’t get there in the future,'” he said. “We did date for a little bit afterwards, but ultimately the distance between us was too challenging. That seems to have been the primary motivator. But there might be more to it, honestly. There might be a reason why I said no, there might be a reason why we’re not dating. That’s a little unclear at the moment.”</p><p>Micah also confirmed to E! News that she and Paul dated after their wedding. “We took some time to process everything that happened and then we did resume dating,” she said. “In the end, it felt like the foundation wasn’t steady enough to continue.” While Micah also admitted that distance played a part in her and Paul’s split, she also told E! News that she didn’t leave Seattle until she felt she and Paul were over.&nbsp;“At that point, I decided to go back to Arizona,” she said. “It just didn’t feel like we were both all in. We just had a lot of hurt from what had happened in the past.” (Paul, for his part, confirmed during the Love Is Blind season 4 reunion that he “visited” Micah in “Arizona briefly” but their relationship “ended pretty quickly after that.”</p><p>Still, Paul told E! News that he still had love for Micah. “We’ve always had this thing where we want to support one another no matter what is happening,” Paul said. “Whether it’s going well or going bad for us, we’re still there for each other.” Micah added, “Paul will always have a special place in my heart.”</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> after the Love Is Blind season 4 finale, Micah revealed why she wanted Paul to answer first at the altar. “I think as a viewer, it might seem like I was afraid of saying yes and him saying no. It was actually quite the opposite,” she said. “I felt like if I said yes, he might feel like he had to and like he was backed in a corner. And I wanted him to answer for him.” She continued, “I wanted him to say yes or say no because it’s what he felt was right in his heart. And I think the only way to do that, knowing him so well, was for him to go ahead and answer first.”</p><p>Micah confirmed that she would’ve said “I do” at the altar if Paul said the same. “A huge fear of mine was that I was going to say yes and he would say yes just because he felt like he had to,” she said. “Or he didn’t want to embarrass me, or ‘Okay, well, maybe if she thinks so, maybe I do too.'” She continued, “But the reality is is you have to know and you have to know in your heart to make that commitment to someone. And he did know and it was to say no.”</p><p>Micah also responded to her friend Shelby’s criticism of Paul and how she didn’t think they should’ve gotten married.&nbsp;“I think the thing with Shelby is she does not put anything lightly. I think she’s a really blunt person, but she is also my person,” she said. “She is my sister, she’s my best friend. I think everything that she did came strictly from love. She did not want me to get hurt. She’s been there through every single heartbreak that I’ve had, and she was just not going to let it happen again.”</p><p>She continued, “If she didn’t think Paul was the right person, she was going to say something. But I did have to take everything that she said, of course, with a grain of salt because she didn’t know our whole story.”</p><p>Micah and Paul met and got engaged in The Pods on Love Is Blind season 4. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in March 2023, Micah responded to edits of a love triangle between her, Paul and Kwame, another Love Is Blind season 4 contestant, who she rejected in The Pods before she got engaged to Paul. “I personally know that when I chose Paul in the pods, I did not waver on that. I never had an interest in Kwame going forward,” she said. “I think the way that I interact with people could come off as flirty, which I totally understand, but in reality, that’s how I am, that’s how I act. I want to stay genuine to who I am. I’m not going to put on a show and be stiff, I was myself.” She continued, “The only regret I would have is causing anyone else pain or causing their relationship issues. That’s something that I would regret and hope that it didn’t cause any issues.”</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Today</a> in March 2023, Irina—another Love Is Blind season 4 contestant who was Micah’s best friend in The Pods—also responded to edits of a love triangle between her, Micah and Paul. The drama came after Irina revealed to Micah that she was had feelings for Paul after seeing him in person following her breakup with Zach, another Love Is Blind season 4 contestant whom she got engaged to in The Pods. . “I had absolutely no intention of pursuing anything with Paul,” Irina told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Today</a>. “I might have had a moment where I had a lot of alcohol, I might have been a little flirty, but I had no intention of breaking anything off with them.” She continued, “Meeting Paul just helped me realize what I felt like I had so naturally when I met Paul, I was trying so hard to have with Zack and I didn’t…So, I feel like that just was kind of like a moment where I was like, ‘Hey I don’t want to marry somebody that I’m trying to, force this connection with,” she says.</p><p>Irina also confirmed to Today that she and Micah are still best friends even after their drama over Paul. “Micah was my best friend and she still is,” she said. Micah added, “Sometimes friendships need these hurdles in order to grow and I think that her and I both grew a lot on the show. Sometimes that’s all you need is a friend to grow with and that’s hopefully something we can do in the future.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=are-kwame-and-chelsea-still-together-from-love-is-blind-season-4>Are Kwame and Chelsea still together from Love Is Blind season 4?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Kwame-Chelsea-Love-Is-Blind-Season-4.png><p><strong>Relationship status</strong>: Married</p><p>Are Kwame and Chelsea still together from Love Is Blind season 4? The answer is yes. Kwame Appiah and Chelsea Griffin were one of three couples who got married in the Love Is Blind season 4 finale.&nbsp; Public court records from King County, Washington, where Seattle is located and Love Is Blind season 4 was filmed, also confirmed this. According to King County’s official records search, Kwame and Chelsea received a marriage application on April 26, 2022, and obtained their marriage certificate on May 4, 2022. They were one of three couples from Love Is Blind season 4 who obtained marriage certificates, confirming they got married. Both the marriage application and marriage certificate list the grantor as “Kwame Appiah” and the grantee as “Chelsea Lauren Griffin.”</p><p>Kwame and Chelsea confirmed they were still together during the Love Is Blind Season 4 “After the Altar” special, which saw them living together. In an interview with <a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#>Today</a> after the Love Is Blind Season 4 finale, Chelsea also confirmed that she and Kwame were still together and that she met his mother for the first time during Thanksgiving 2022. “It was a beautiful time,” she said. “It was a loud, fun, loving family and I loved it. Yes, there’s still room to grow with his mom but it was a perfect first visit. She really saw my character and who I was.” Chelsea also told Today that she understood Kwame’s mother’s hesitation with their relationship.</p><p>“This was a very non-traditional, fast experience where he had to follow his own heart. That does have consequences and we’ve worked through that,” she said. Kwame, for his part, told Today that he’s come to understand his mother’s point of view more as time has passed. “This was a very non-trad”I’ve realized this is more complicated, even when you take the experiment and the show out of it. Meeting someone and getting married is such a complicated situation,” he said. “It made sense that she wanted me to take more time and be more considerate of what the journey really is. But we’re on great terms right now.” He continued, “I’m so grateful for my mom. And I’m very happy with where we are. I think we’re progressing at the right rate to make sure that we all end up happy on the other end.”</p><p>Kwame also confirmed that Chelsea met his mother in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a> after the Love Is Blind season 4 finale. “They get along well, well enough. It’s progress. I think as time has gone on, I’ve started to think about things more from my mom’s side and I understand… but it took her some time to warm up to the whole situation,” Kwame said. “I’m happy with the way it’s progressing. If this is meant to be for the rest of our lives, then I’m OK with the wait and patience.” He also revealed that he relocated from Portland, Oregon, to Seattle, Washington, to be with Chelsea. “Since transitioning to Seattle, I’ve definitely found a lot of love for it. I love this place, and I don’t think that the next transition in my life would be happier in any other place,” Kwame said.</p><p>As for Chelsea, she described her and Kwame’s marriage as “real.” “Marriage is not easy, but doing it at the pace that we’ve had to do it has been extra difficult… we moved in together the day after we got married,” she said. “He’d never lived with a woman. Honestly, I think he did really well.” She also told Entertainment Tonight that watching Love Is Blind season 4 back “110 percent” strengthened her and Kwame’s relationship. “I will say, reality <a href=# id=auto-tag_tv data-tag=tv>TV</a>, it sucks you in and makes you feel like you know everything and in reality, you don’t,” Chelsea said. “I’m proud and happy with my trajectory, but other people on the show did not get so lucky… A lot of Kwame and I’s story and a lot of our dates never got shown to push a storyline. That’s frustrating for me to watch back and not see a lot of those moments.”</p><p>Chelsea also slammed racist and hateful comments Kwame received after her and Chelsea’s relationship on Love Is Blind season 4. “It was really difficult to see and feel for him. It was horrible. It was absolutely the most disgusting, demeaning things that I’ve ever, ever seen and it really hurts me. It hurts me for him and it hurts me for us and for the community. The internet, it’s a scary place. People can say and do anything. It’s not OK,” Chelsea said. “I just held him and we cried together. I’ve never seen him like that before. I can understand to the degree that I can. I wish that I could get there fully, but I can’t. I think he reached out to a lot of his friends and family.”</p><p>Kwame and Chelsea met and got engaged in The Pods on Love Is Blind season 4. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in March 2023, Chelsea confirmed that she has no animosity toward Micah, another Love Is Blind season 4 contestant who rejected Kwame before he got engaged to Chelsea. “It was a part of our journey,” she said. “You’re going into an experience where the person that you like is dating 15 other women. It is a very unique experience, and we are multifaceted people and it’s okay for him to make that connection that he had with Micah.” She continued, “And in Mexico, there was tequila flowing, there was a lot happening, and you have cameras all around you. It’s an elevated, intense experience.”</p><p>Chelsea told People that she noticed Kwame and Micah connecting at a pool party in Mexico but “it wasn’t in my nature to interject in their conversation.” While Kwame and Micah had “some closure that needed to happen,” Chelsea confessed that watching her fiance with his ex “was uncomfortable at times.” Chelsea continued, “I respect Kwame’s journey, and I don’t have any bad blood towards Micah. The way I see it, if someone else is so into my man, then she’s probably cool. She’s probably awesome like me. I do feel that. And there’s no bad blood there. And I just think everything happened for a reason.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=are-jackie-and-marshall-still-together-from-love-is-blind-season-4>Are Jackie and Marshall still together from Love Is Blind season 4?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Jackie-Marshall-Love-Is-Blind-Season-4.jpg><p><strong>Relationship status</strong>: Broken up</p><p>Are Jackie and Marshall still together from Love Is Blind season 4?

I make sure that my parents are good, the bill is paid — my dad can’t work no more. I have a lot of family stuff that I have to tend to. Family always comes first. And also, my brother being released from prison, it’s like I have another person to take care of.”</p><p>Jackie explained that it was hard for her to focus on the vacation while still remembering the reality of her father. “My life is not for someone who can’t be up to par in supporting me, and just making sure that you understand my life and knowing that this is always going to be a part of me,” she said. “That was an emotional moment for me because I didn’t feel like, at that moment, Marshall was up to par and ready for all of the reality that I have back home.” Marshall added, “That was extremely personal to Jackie and it’s not my place to speak on it. I’m just glad that I was there to help her through that.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=are-tiffany-and-brett-still-together-from-love-is-blind-season-4>Are Tiffany and Brett still together from Love Is Blind season 4?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tiffany-Brett-Love-Is-Blind-Season-4.jpg><p><strong>Relationship status</strong>: Married</p><p>Are Tiffany and Brett still together from Love Is Blind season 4?

But I’m talking and I’m realizing that I’m not really hearing anything else from the other side,” Brett said. “And then I’d come to find out that she’d fallen asleep.” Tiffany told People that she was “nervous” about how her falling asleep would affect their relationship. “I was definitely nervous to talk to him the next day to see if he forgave me and just to see how we can move past that,” she said. “Luckily, he did.” Brett also joked about his calming voice to Today.&nbsp;“Maybe I have another career in like calm radio or something like that, soothing people down when you’re ready to go to sleep. Just turn on Brett’s voice and I’ll put you to bed,” he said. “I don’t know, maybe she gifted me something I didn’t know that I had.”</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Weekly</a> in March 2023, Tiffany explained how she fell asleep in The Pods in the first place. “Just to take you back to that moment, it was a long day. It’s hours and hours of conversations. And I’m not a nighttime person. I saw it as like, ‘Oh, let me just rest my eyes for a second,'” she said. “And unfortunately I passed out, which I really regret during that exact moment. To this day, I still don’t know what Brett was saying to me in the pods, so I’m eagerly awaiting to view that moment to see how he professes love to me. Or even if he did, I don’t know.”</p><p>Brett told Entertainment Weekly that it took him 10 minutes without Tiffany responding before he left The Pods. “Oh man, it was probably a good 10 minutes. I haven’t seen the edit, so I don’t really know what’s in [the episode], but I left the pod. When I came back in, that’s when I found out that she was asleep. So that was probably about 10 minutes,” he said. “Originally I thought it was a mechanical issue, like an audio issue with her mic. It never crossed my mind and she went night-night. But she went night-night.”</p><p>As for how she fell asleep, Tiffany explained that it was due to alcohol and exhaustion from long filming days. “Yeah, it’s more the exhaustion though,” she said. “I can’t even tell you what time it was. It was probably 11-something at night. I usually go to bed at 10, so it was more exhaustion than anything. I wasn’t drinking in the pods like that because I really wanted to be clearheaded, so unfortunately I’m going to attribute that to my sleep.”</p><p>Tiffany and Brett confirmed how long it took before they were able to speak again. “That was the next day, because I didn’t talk to him for the rest of the day. I passed out, date was over, it was time for us to go home,” Tiffany said. “It was the next day, and it was just me explaining what happened. I really don’t know what I said at that time, I was just speaking from the heart because it was not intentional. I wanted him to know that I meant everything that I said. I do regret sleeping, but I didn’t regret telling him that I was falling in love with him at that time.” Brett continued, “Honestly, when I went back to the hotel that night, when I really took the emotions out of it, I realized we’re all human. I mean, I’m pretty sure all of us can probably think of a time that we’ve been on a phone conversation with somebody that went very long and you realized you just dozed off. It wasn’t something that was intentional, so it didn’t take me that long to get over it.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=are-zack-and-bliss-still-together-from-love-is-blind-season-4>Are Zack and Bliss still together from Love Is Blind season 4?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Zack-Bliss-Love-Is-Blind-Season-4.png><p><strong>Relationship status</strong>: Married</p><p>Are Zack and Bliss still together from Love Is Blind season 4? The answer is yes. Zack Goytowski and Bliss Poureetezadi were one of three couples who got married in the Love Is Blind season 4 finale. Public court records from King County, Washington, where Seattle is located and Love Is Blind season 4 was filmed, also confirmed this. According to King County’s official records search, Zack and Bliss received a marriage application on April 26, 2022, and obtained their marriage certificate on May 24, 2022. They were one of three couples from Love Is Blind season 4 who obtained marriage certificates, confirming they got married. Both the marriage application and marriage certificate list the grantor as “Bliss Shahdi Erika Poureetezadi” and the grantee as “Zachary Joseph Goytowski.”</p><p>Zack and Bliss confirmed they were still together during the Love Is Blind Season 4 “After the Altar” special, which saw them living together. In an interview with <a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> after the Love Is Blind season 4 finale, Zack confirmed that his relationship with Bliss’ father had improved after their wedding. “He has called me his son. It felt really good, honestly,” Zack said of a moment between him and Bliss’ father at their wedding. “He gave me this look of approval. Like a nod. He may not necessarily have agreed with our decision, but he respected me, so that definitely meant a lot.” As for his and Bliss’ marriage at the time, Zach told Entertainment Tonight, “It’s really good. It’s great, honestly.” Zach added of his in-laws, “I love Bliss’ family. They’re amazing.”</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> after the Love Is Blind season 4 finale, Bliss looked back on her wedding day with Zack. “Oh my gosh. I’m amazed,” she said. “And I really want to give props to all the people behind the scenes that make this stuff happen, and make the pods, and the experience, and everything go around. It’s so much work.” She continued, “I was in love with how everything looked. It was absolutely beautiful. It was just what I imagined. I really loved it. And it was everything that I wanted.” Bliss also called her and Zack’s first dance—which was to Lee Ann Womack and The Sons’ “I Hope You Dance,” a song they bonded over in The Pods—”so beautiful and wonderful.” Bliss continued of her “perfect” wedding day: “There were dresses set out for me that I was looking through. And I was like, hmm. But then this dress actually got shipped to the location that we were at, literally while we were there. It was just this magical moment. Everything just felt so serendipitous and beautiful.”</p><p>She added, “That was the dress. That was it. Because everything else just wasn’t hitting the mark for me, and it literally shipped there while we were filming there. And it was amazing,” she notes. “I loved that dress. It was perfect. Everything that kept happening after we got back together just kept affirming that this was the right thing.”</p><p>Bliss also revealed to People that she and Zack “discussed” whether they were planning to say “I do” or “I don’t” at the altar. “We had agreed and discussed about saying yes,” she said. “I wanted there to be space for us to say no at the altar if we decided that we were going to say no. I wanted to make sure that I gave that for both of us, because you never want anyone to be forced into a situation. But we were going to say yes, and we knew that we were going to say yes.”</p><p>The conversation over their wedding came after Bliss’ father’s doubt over her and Zack’s fast relationship. “Honestly, that’s just my dad’s personality. He’s going to be skeptical. I expected him to be skeptical… I would’ve been more weirded out or surprised if he wasn’t skeptical because that’s just how he is,” she said. “But I knew that my dad, ultimately at the end of the day, is going to trust me to make the right decision for myself.” She continued, “It wasn’t even a matter of him not accepting who Zack was. It was more just not accepting of a marriage so quickly. I think that’s important to make that distinction because it had nothing to do with who Zack was as a person, if that makes sense.”</p><p>Bliss also told People that she hoped her and Zack’s relationship sends a message to viewers about the importance of second chances.&nbsp;“My hope is that they see that this really is a story of second chances that we’ve all really needed. This man gave me no reason to not trust in his honesty and his intentions. So, I hope that’s what they see,” she said.</p><p>Zack and Bliss met in The Pods on Love Is Blind season 4, but didn’t get engaged after Zack broke up with Bliss to propose to Irina. Zack and Irina broke up in episode 5 at the end of their vacation in Mexico after they both realized their relationship wasn’t working. Zack and Bliss reunited after Zack’s breakup with Irina and got engaged.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Today</a> in March 2023, Irina also responded to her feud with Bliss, who Zack rejected before he got engaged to Irina. “Me and Bliss didn’t have the best moments in the lounge, but I have absolutely no harsh feelings towards her,” Irina said. Irina also revealed that she encouraged Zack to pursue Bliss after their breakup. “I think what’s meant to be, will be,” she said.</p><p>Irina also confirmed to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> that she and Bliss have no animosity.&nbsp;“Before me and Zack broke up, I told him, if he wanted to go to pursue something with Bliss that he should,” she said. “I have no bad blood with her at all, but I could see how she could have some bad blood with me,” She continued, “Obviously, that’s going to be uncomfortable or hard maybe to watch. But me and Zack weren’t supposed to be together, and we are not together for a reason.”</p><p>Bliss, for her part, told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in April 2023 that she “didn’t have any expectations” when she and Zack reunited, though she admitted “there was a very intense physical chemistry that really just shocked me when I walked in.” “There really wasn’t [any hesitation]. He just showed me the person that he is over and over again. I felt like I knew that he was my person,” she said of Zack’s proposal. “Honestly, I was so shocked. I had no idea it was coming. I’m glad I was surprised with it.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=are-jackie-and-josh-still-together-from-love-is-blind-season-4>Are Jackie and Josh still together from Love Is Blind season 4?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Jackie-Josh-Love-Is-Blind-Season-4.png><p><strong>Relationship status</strong>: Dating</p><p>Are Jackie and Josh still together from Love Is Blind season 4? The answer is yes. Jackelina Bonds and Josh Demas met in The Pods on Love Is Blind season 4, but didn’t get engaged after Jackie broke up with Josh to get engaged to Marshall. Jackie and Marshall broke up in episode 10 after Jackie skipped her wedding dress fitting and and went on a date with Josh, where they kissed.</p><p>Jackie and Josh confirmed they were still together during the Love Is Blind Season 4 “After the Altar” special, which saw them move in together. TikTok user @<a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#>snowflake1971</a> also confirmed Jackie and Josh were still together with a video of them at a Seattle Mariners game in March 2023. “look who I seen last night,” the user captioned the video, which showed Jackie and Josh walking to their seats. In April 2023, an anonymous Instagram account believed to be Jackie’s friend also allegedly leaked a group text between Jackie and her friends at the time she broke up with Marshall to be with Josh. “He gives me vibes. YALL and I kinda hinted at that in my interview & all hell broke lose [sic]. So I had to like switch it up,” Jackie allegedly wrote in the group text of Marshall. “But he fosho gives me vibes cause he use to twrk on the bed & I told him I was coo off that & he was like yeah. So now this time I told him to be more aggressive with me. He’s hard fosho but sometimes he can be SWEET.” One friend allegedly texted back, “TWERK ON THE BED? LMFAOOOOO. JACKIE. Good for you, also, for communicating how bad of a turn off that shit is wth.”</p><p>Jackie allegedly texted back, “Yes he will twerk on the bed & I was like yeah no that’s not gone fly big homie lol & then he will talk like ‘yasss’ & im like ?????? THATS THE DAMN TRUTH. ION WANNA HEAR YALL AT MY WEDDING YELLIN BOUT HOW HE GOT SUGAR IN HIS TANK EITHER PLASSS. we gotta make it stretch for tv bye.” A second friend allegedly texted back, “LMAOOO nooo gotta make it to the altar.” Jackie allegedly responded, “I can hear [REDACTED] yellin ‘HES A TEAPOT'” The account also shared an alleged screenshot of a DM from Jackie in which she sent a video of her and Josh with the message: “My baby.”After the the texts went viral, Marshall responded to them in a tweet which read, “The only ‘sugar’ I got goes on those f*cking pancakes.”</p><p>Jackie also confirmed she and Josh were still together in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Today</a> in April 2023, in which she recalled the first time they met in person. “The first time I ever saw Josh, it was very surreal because I’ve never seen him before and walking into Chelsea’s party, I only heard his voice,” she said. “I instantly had a That’s So Raven moment where I was kind of like a flashback. He’s good looking. He’s smelling good, but I’m not hearing any of the words like he’s telling me, because I’m just not present at that time.” As for their relationship now, Jackie told Today, “Going forward and moving forward with Josh. It was actually very surreal. It was actually very intimate, very soul-binding, I would say, because it’s almost kind of like, we are very strong.”</p><p>Jackie also confirmed that she and Josh were still together in an interview with<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> Entertainment Tonight</a> after the Love Is Blind season 4 reunion. “Me and Josh are still going strong,” she said at the time. “We are getting a place together. He hangs out with my family all the time.” She also confirmed the relationship in an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> post at the time. “A year of standing side by side with my other half. Our journey to find each other was not easy but it was worth it. Thank you for loving me, standing by me and protecting me. I love you forever and through every realm &nbsp;@jdemas Thank you @loveisblindnetflix for this amazing experience,” she captioned a photo of her and Josh.</p><p>After the Love Is Blind season 4 reunion, Jackie also apologized for her behavior toward Marshall during their season. “I would like to start this off by saying I sincerely apologize and take accountability for my actions and words in my relationship between Marshall and I,” she wrote in an Instagram post. “I also want to take the time to express my gratitude and appreciation for Marshall clearing up that I did in fact end the relationship before meeting Josh at the coffee shop. I understand that it was a quick transition from one relationship to another but this relationship did not start as most do in the real world.”</p><p>She continued, “To some it may seem as if it was a quick transition, however there is only a small percent that can be shown on tv and my connection with Josh was much deeper than it seems from a viewers perspective. I also would like to thank Marshall for taking accountability the derogatory comment that was made off camera.”</p><p>Jackie also admitted to <a href=# rel=noopener>leaked text messages</a> between her and her friends, in which she suggested that Marshall wasn’t honest to her about his sexuality. “I would also like to apologize and take accountability for my disparaging remarks as well in those leaked messages,” she wrote. “It was tasteless and disrespectful to speak about anyone that way. It was never a battle between Marshall and I. I just wanted to clear the timeline of the events that took place as it looked as if I was a cheater and starting one relationship before leaving the other. “</p><p>She continued, “I am thankful that Vanessa Lachey allowed me to speak my peace and take accountability for my actions. All I can do is learn and grow from this experience. Like Marshall said at the reunion we both deserve happiness, peace, and to be able move on from what transpired last year. Marshall and I have personally apologized to each and also took accountability for our actions and have moved on. I would also like to apologize and take accountability to the public as it was done on the show for everyone to see. Actions speak louder than words.”</p><p>In an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> post after her last episode of Love Is Blind season 4, Jackie also accused the show’s editing of making it seem like she went on a date with Josh before breaking up with Marshall. “I have seen the latest episodes that have premiered on Love Is Blind and I must speak the truth. Marshall and I werre broken up before I saw Josh at the coffee shop,” she wrote. “I am wearing different clothes, my hair is styled different and at the end of the video I say “I DON’T KNOW IF I AM GOING TO BE WITH JOSH.” I am not sure what the reason is for playing the coffee shop date before the break up but to restate, Marshall and I were broken up before Josh and I had our coffee shop date. As for the ring, Marshall did not pay for the ring. Love Is Blind paid for all the rings.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=where-was-love-is-blind-season-4-filmed>Where was Love Is Blind season 4 filmed?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Love-Is-Blind-Season-4.jpg><p>Love Is Blind season 4 was filmed in Seattle, Washington. Love Is Blind season 1 was filmed in Atlanta, Georgia; season 2 was filmed in Chicago, Illinois; and season 3 was filmed in Dallas, Texas. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a> in 2020, Love Is Blind creator Chris Coelen explained that each season casts contestants from the same city so long distance isn’t a factor in their relationships. “It was a really interesting and diverse cast in terms of the fact that they were all from many different places originally,” he said. “But they were all living around the Atlanta area [at the time of casting]. The reason that we did that was because we wanted to give these people a real shot at making their relationships work for the long term.”</p><p>He continued, “Whether you think [love] is going to happen or not, we wanted people that would be ready to be married. If you’re really in it—genuinely in it, which was the No. 1 casting criteria—it felt to us that it was too much of a bridge for someone living in Miami and someone living in Seattle to build. We thought let’s at least start with them in the same geographical area.”</p><p>Coelen also explained to <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> in 2020 about why he wanted each Love Is Blind season to cast contestants from the same city. “We wanted people to all be living, currently in the same place. It’s too difficult if you’re from Tampa and they’re from Portland, that just throws another wrench in. We wanted to give them a real shot at making their love and their marriage working,” he said. Coelen also told Variety at the time about the locations he was looking at for future Love Is Blind seasons. “Look, the idea is that ultimately we’re going to do this in other countries—it’s very global. There’s lots of places that that we could take it. Chicago is a great place to look at, so is New York, Boston, Houston. There’s so many different places that we could go. And like I said, outside of the country as well,” he said.</p><p>Coelen also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Oprah</a> magazine in 2020 that The Pods lasted around 10 days, which started with a series of speed dates between contestants that lasted between eight to 12 minutes. We did a ranking system, from who you though was most compatible to least compatible after the first date. Every day, the list got shorter and shorter,” Love Is Blind season 1 contestant Mark Cuevas told Oprah magazine at the time. Coelen also told Oprah magazine made the cast smaller a few days into the The Pods stage to focus on the contestants forming “real connections.” “We ended up focusing on people who were really forming real connections,” he said.</p><p>Though the dates started short, Coelen told Variety that the producers allowed contestants to have longer dates once they saw how strong their connections were. “In the beginning nobody knew who anybody was. So we structured it so that they would have an opportunity to talk to everyone. They were never given any instruction on what to say or what not to say or what they could ask about or what they couldn’t ask about. And you see on the show, some people decided to [ask] ‘How tall are you, what do you look like?'” he said. “Other people were like, ‘Why would I ever do that? That’s not the point of this.’ We really wanted it to be their own story, their own journey. We would set it up so they had the opportunity to talk to everybody. Then from that point [it was monitored]. Let’s say somebody really wanted to talk to you and you’re like, ‘Yeah, I have no interest in that person.'”</p><p>He continued, “You’re not going to talk to them. It doesn’t matter. We’re not going to arrange people to speak to one another where somebody’s like, ‘yeah, I don’t want to talk to that person.’ We just wouldn’t do that. Multiple points throughout the day we had to break and they had to eat, go to the bathroom, go do interviews, but generally we wanted to give them as much time in the pods as possible with the people that they genuinely wanted to talk to. These dates are obviously cut down but they were hours and hours and hours long.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Nick-Lachey-Vanessa-Lachey-Love-Is-Blind.jpg><p>The Love Is Blind season 4 hosts are Nick Lachey and Vanessa Lachey, who have hosted the series since it premiered in February 2020.

Nick has also released four solo alums: SoulO, What’s Left of Me, A Father’s Lullaby and Soundtrack of My Life. He was married to Jessica Simpson from 2002 to 2006, and the two also starred in their own reality show, Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica on MTV, from 2003 to 2005.

We didn’t get to see each other a lot so we had a lot of long phone conversations, learning everything we possibly could about each other.” He continued, “[Those conversations were] really important for building our relationship and knowing we wanted the same things before there were external pressures on the relationship.” Nick also told Distractify that he and Vanessa want contestants to “fall in love for the right reasons and then introduce everything else.”</p><p>Nick also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in 2022 about how he thinks Love Is Blind would’ve worked for him and Vanessa if they had met in The Pods.&nbsp;“We’ve thought about that, often. And I really, I’m not just saying this for the benefit of this show, I think we would’ve,” he said. “We have the same birthday, we have the same passions, we have the same interests, we have the same drive. Things that motivated us.” Vanessa asked “You would’ve found me through a wall?” to which Nick responded, “I would find you anywhere.” He continued, “I really do think we would’ve found each other. I think we would’ve gravitated to each other. That’s what we did in life. Obviously, we knew each other.” Vanessa added, “We did.
