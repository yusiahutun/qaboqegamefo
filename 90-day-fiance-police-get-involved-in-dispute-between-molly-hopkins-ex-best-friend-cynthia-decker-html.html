The 90 Day Fiancé duo had a falling out in November 2022. They have been together as business partners in <a href=#>their boutique, LiviRae Lingerie</a>, in Kennesaw, Georgia.</p><p id=par-3_45>In 2013, the duo even had their own reality TV show on the Lifetime network called Double Divas, which documented the drama at the boutique. For many seasons, the besties were also a staple on 90 Day Fiancé: Pillow Talk for their funny commentary.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_46>Molly posted on the LiviRae Instagram account on December 13, 2022, that their store is still up and running. “Please note regardless of internal changes, we are still very much in business and our doors are open and we are operating as normal,” Molly wrote.</p><p id=par-5_24>Molly’s friendship with Cynthia ended around the same time that her relationship with her ex-boyfriend, Kelly Brown, ended after two years of dating.</p><h2>Police respond to a dispute at Molly and Cynthia’s boutique</h2><p id=par-6_43>According to the police report obtained by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">InTouch</a>, the police responded to a call at Molly and Cynthia’s business, LiviRae Lingerie, around noon on Jan. 22. Officer M.P. Brown of the Cobb County Police Department detailed the dispute between Molly and Cynthia.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_58>The police reports reveal that the former Pillow Talk duo was arguing over an employee, Angelique Benton. Molly had fired Benton for allegedly stealing from the lingerie boutique. Cynthia had rehired Benton as she believed the “allegations were false.” Cynthia told the officer that she and Molly’s relationship has been strained since “parting ways in the business.”</p><h2>Molly’s daughter Olivia wanted the employee removed from the store</h2><p id=par-8_26>Since Molly was in Florida at the time, her 22-year-old daughter, Olivia, stepped in and wanted the Cobb Police Department to aid in “Angelique’s removal.”</p><p id=par-9_32>“Olivia gave a similar account of events, and I informed Olivia that this was a civil issue between owners and that we could not remove Angelique from LiviRae’s,” Officer Brown revealed.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-10_44>“I further advised Olivia that she should stay away from Cynthia when she is at the store in order to keep the incident from escalating. Both Cynthia and Olivia wanted to have documentation of the incident for their records,” the officer concluded.</p><p id=par-11_39>There has been a lot of drama since a separate incident occurred between Olivia and Molly’s ex-boyfriend, Kelly. He allegedly “choke slammed” Olivia at LiviRae on Nov. 21, 2022. Since that incident, <a href=#>Molly and Kelly have split up</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSGcXnDmrBmnpmWu6SxjKmmpaGTmnqosdNmoKeun6HDprCMoqVmnJmovbbAxGaZnqynmrKvecyoo6WxXZ28sbfIp6pmnahir6a%2F02adq6GVo7Fur9inq6GhkWKxpq%2FKnqlnoKSiuXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
