It was perhaps their worst fight since Gemma filed for divorce three months earlier. Each side fired off accusations of cheating and overspending. Gemma said in court that Ian wasn't taking medication for his bipolar disorder.</span></p><p><span>That Sunday, an upset Ian picked up two of his daughters, 5 and 7, and walked with them down Ocean Boulevard. Onlookers told authorities the girls appeared to be trying to free themselves as the dad wrapped his arms around them.</span></p><p><span>A few minutes later, Gemma and the couple's friends showed up in an SUV.

As the witness drove away, she heard the gun shots — two quick bursts from the 9mm pistol.</span></p><p><span>A jogger, who at first thought he'd heard fireworks, walked by and saw Ian still with his gun in hand — his dead wife on the ground.</span></p><p><span>'Get out of here!' Ian told the man, according to the Sun-Sentinel.</span></p><p><span>The jogger crossed the street, where another witness was on the phone with a 911 dispatcher.
