But while I was excited to throw myself into the detox, I was also sceptical about my willpower. The thought of consuming nothing but juice for seven days seemed very daunting as it got to Sunday evening… Would I be able to do it? Would I even be able to start?!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3ae883ba9988-juice-3-z.jpg><p id=ezfrqG6GxIjp data-wc=180>Turns out, to my surprise as much as to my boyfriend and parents', that I would. The week started off well. Initially I was unsure about the green colour of juices that contained broccoli and spinach, but they were absolutely delicious. All of them – I had no problem whatsoever finishing them off, especially lovely apple and gingers juices with fresh mint. And I was surprised at how easy it was to create the juices. I did, however, have the help of a high-tech, super quick and stylish Philips Avance juicer, which basically did the work for me – apples, a key ingredient of nearly all the juices, do not even need to be peeled. I also had the help of a lovely PR firm who very generously supplied me with a mountain of fruit and veg. Towards the end did, however, the detox became quite difficult. Despite not actually feeling hungry, or having hunger pains, I found myself really craving bread and a warm, home-cooked meal but reassured myself with the thought that food wasn't far from my reach.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d511e3f89011-juice-2-z.jpg><p id=ehgQ5Qotrd9O data-wc=137>&nbsp;Not being able to drink tea in work – I can't stomach herbal teas – was also really difficult. With colleagues sipping away from big mugs left, right and centre, I struggled to stay on the wagon. But negatives aside, I am delighted to manage to stick out the detox. The seven days up, I was delighted to hop onto the scales and see I had lost six pounds. I also feel lighter, far more energetic and friends have even said, much to my delight, that I look radiant! While I won't be jumping at the chance to give it another go until I need to drop some weight – and fast – I would definitely recommend for anyone that has a few pounds to shed or simply wants to give their digestive systems a good cleanout.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dfdb77128b4f-juice-z.jpg><p id=eQh0aAt-RmPM data-wc=14>Visit https://www.juicemaster.com for more details or to purchase a Phillips Advance Juicer visit https://www.juicemaster.com/shop/philips-avance-hr1871.html</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
