 Angela Epstein was eventually told there was nothing wrong

The UK market is worth £65million.</span></p><p><span>They can cost anything from £20 for a home cholesterol-testing kit to hundreds of pounds for a full body MOT. Critics claim most of these tests aren’t necessary and prey on the ‘worried well’, often giving false-positive and, worse, false-negative results. But then, say the companies, it’s better to be safe than sorry. It’s a persuasive argument on both sides, and I have always been ambivalent.</span></p><p><span>However, the debate became all too relevant to me this year when I agreed to have a cutting-edge eye-scanning test known as Optomap. My experience&nbsp; has left me convinced that a little&nbsp; knowledge really can be a bad thing – and I now believe these tests may well&nbsp; do more harm than good.</span></p><p><span>The Optomap machine is able to produce a scan of the retina – the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye – in unparalleled detail. It’s much more detailed than a routine eye test, which offers the optician a view of about 30 per cent of the retina. The practitioner will ask the patient to move their eyes&nbsp; to view the peripheral retina, but even so will manage to see only a little more.</span></p><p><span>‘The Optomap Retinal Examination enables a specialist to view between 80 and 85 per cent of the retina,’ explains Professor Paulo Stanga, ophthalmologist at the Manchester Royal Eye Hospital. He uses the machine for patients who have been referred to his care for ocular issues.</span></p><p><span>Manufacturers say that by providing a more thorough screening of the retina, the scan can lead to early detection of common diseases, such as glaucoma, diabetes, macular degeneration and cancer.</span></p><h2><span>Prof Stanga was silenced momentarily as images of my right-hand retina appeared</span>&nbsp;</h2><p><span>There is no question that in Britain we need to take better care of our vision. According to new research by Boots and the RNIB, 50 per cent of sight loss is avoidable, with four in ten people not&nbsp; having their eyes checked on a regular basis. The Optomap test is now being offered at private clinics and high street optometrists to anyone concerned about eye health. And at between £10 and £60&nbsp; a test, why wouldn’t you want this most advanced kind of examination?</span></p><p><span>To take the test, I peered into a hole in the side of the Optomap machine. A laser scans the eyes from behind a wall of glass and this produces digital images of the retina. It’s quick and painless.</span></p><p><span>After showing me pictures of my left eye and assuring me of its good health, Prof Stanga was silenced momentarily as images of my right-hand retina appeared. ‘I don’t know what that is,’ he remarked evenly after a few seconds as he magnified what looked like a few black pin pricks. ‘I’ll have to take a closer look.’</span></p><p><span>It was a stomach-lurching moment – even more so as I was a healthy, symptom-free patient who had elected to have a scan simply because it was available.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/04/07/article-0-12818B34000005DC-475_468x352.jpg height=352 width=468 alt="This scan shows the retina through the front of Angela's eye - and, circled, the pigmented area that caused concern" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>This scan shows the retina through the front of Angela's eye - and, circled, the pigmented area that caused concern</p><p><span>In my case, the machine identified what Prof Stanga described as hyper-pigmentation in my right eye. On hearing this, I changed from inquisitive health journalist to patient, and begin spinning into a paroxysm of panic.</span></p><p><span>Thoughts of cancer flashed through my mind – though Prof Stanga immediately assured me that the black dots didn’t look like that. I was called back the next day to have a comprehensive eye examination.</span></p><p><span>First there were eye drops to dilate my pupils, then more to anaesthetise them. Prof Stanga then carried out what is known as indirect ophthalmoscopy with 360 degrees indentation: while staring into bright lights, the eyes are pushed with a probe, which feels like&nbsp; a sharp rod.</span></p><p><span>I was quaking during the examination. The bright light felt as if it was blinding me. I knew Prof Stanga was at the top&nbsp; of his field, but it is totally unnatural to have someone pressing your eyes – and I hated it. Lying back, I felt paralysed.</span></p><p><span>‘I have to do this to rule out any retinal tears in the peripheral retina as they can lead to retinal detachment, which can result in loss of vision,’ he explained.</span></p><p><span>By now I was in a state of hyper-anxiety. So the results were the best I could hope for. I had a pigmented vitreoretinal adhesion – the retina had not been torn and this harmless pigmented area could have been there for years.</span></p><p><span>And the treatment? Do nothing. Grateful but slightly shell-shocked, I left.</span></p><p><span>While some opticians and clinics are offering this scan as a seductive extra, my experience begs this question: Why would anyone put themselves through a state-of-the-art scan that can throw up&nbsp; a false-positive and cause huge anxiety?</span></p><p><span>Some specialists couldn’t agree more. Mr Larry Benjamin, consultant ophthalmologist at Stoke Mandeville Hospital and a spokesman for the Royal College of Ophthalmologists, says screening such as this might be helpful for those with conditions such as diabetes.</span></p><p><span>‘If you could spot very early-warning signs in these cases, then more could be done to prevent sight loss. But someone who has no family history of eye problems or disease, no symptoms and no other reason to take the test – aside from the knowledge that it is available – should think twice about having it.’</span></p><p><span>He told me: ‘The majority of us will have little anomalies in the backs of our eyes that are benign – as was your case.’</span></p><p><span>Manchester-based optician Robert Glass, who has elected not to offer this test in his practices, agrees: ‘A routine eye examination, competently carried out by an optometrist, using the more standard equipment available in today’s optical practices, can often be more effective at detecting eye disease.’</span></p><p><span>The Optomap may well be part of a&nbsp; burgeoning industry – indeed Tesco Opticians now offers it in six of its stores for just £10. However, Mr Benjamin says: ‘People should have a standard sight test every two years and only go to see their specialist between tests if they have any symptoms that alarm them.’</span></p><p><span>Tests such as these are supposed to give peace of mind. In my experience, it did everything but that.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKCVlrm1tI6aqa2hk6Gybn6Qa21ucGJkoamxjJ6wnmWjmK6vusSrZKyZp2KVsMOMqamompyaum6%2Fz6irrZ2UYsC2vMSrpJqjlal6tbHSrZyrZZOWwrSxw2asp6aVmLK0v8CrsGaokaO2pHrHraSl</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
