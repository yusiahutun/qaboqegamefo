I'd love to tell you that I'm the kind of sportswoman who can glide down one of the hardest slopes in the world without a second thought, jumping off the two-metre moguls with grace and skillfully carving into the ice at a 76% gradient, but that would be a lie – and quite an embellished one at that.</p><p id=e-wC3RbdWop data-wc=44>Don't get me wrong, I'm not a novice after enjoying a couple of family holidays over the past 20 years. Most recently, that's meant joining my brother and his two daughters aged nine and six for slow-paced runs, relaxed post-ski drinks and early nights.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/7b93845e699f-20240317-234606-androtasovac.jpg><p id=e1UovN9TkZH data-wc=45>But pottering down blue and red runs (for those not aware, colours range from green as the easiest to blue, red and black as the hardest) is a far cry from throwing yourself down an orange. That's right, the Swiss Wall has its own classification!</p><p id=eoeqLHS9Pcv data-wc=34>So how exactly did I fare swapping my chilled holidays with my family for a celebrity-approved festival in Avoriaz? Four weeks later and my sleep schedule still hasn't recovered, if that tells you anything.</p><h2 dir=ltr>The ski slopes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/57011382b3a2-snowboxx2024scottapresresort-02763.jpg><p id=e-HrUYF3hT6 data-wc=36>Swiss Wall aside, the large Portes du Soleil ski area offers a plethora of slopes for any ability – I'm talking 600 km of slopes between two countries.

That should be second nature to seasoned skiers, but it's surprisingly easy to forget the time when you're playing around in fresh snow without a watch easily accessible.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a0d4910acf2b-snowboxx2024scottdopesnowrailjam-00718.jpg><p id=eQmREcrHNqH data-wc=52>If you're after more challenges, head over to the snowparks where you can test out your skills or play spectator to the pros. My attempts were a sorry state of affairs – what felt like a three-foot jump turned out to be less than three inches of air. But practice makes perfect!</p><p id=eE1yQzH4Bdd data-wc=31>Or you could pass tour time trying a bottomless brunch or a spa day in the hotel – the challenge is finding the time to fit everything into your busy schedule.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>The ski festival</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/87d1a15ce736-snowboxxmainstagescott-05041.jpg><p id=eRKGo5gNyag data-wc=38><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Snowboxx</a> puts on themed dress-up days each year, allowing people to showcase their impressive cold-weather wardrobes. This year's was the iconic 80s, so it's safe to say the legendary Folie Douce has never been so bold and colourful.</p><p id=eCE0AWotFqY data-wc=41>If you're feeling up for a lazy afternoon of gastronomy, sit alongside other impeccably dressed retro skiers as you dig into a hearty meal – I can whole-heartedly recommend the traditional Crozets de Savoie, which came with live performances from singers.</p><p id=e4aLbB1cNJ9 data-wc=58>Apres is one of the main attractions of any ski holiday, and it's safe to say that Snowboxx does not disappoint. From around 3 pm onwards, the ski-in, ski-out mountainside bar becomes a magnet for many of the 6,000 festival-goers, including singer Gareth Gates, Hollyoaks Ruby O'Donnell and Love Island's Chloe Burrows, Millie Grace Court and Liam Reardon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b9c3f827bdcd-20240319-163306-5930androtasovac.jpg><p id=e19BwKXnWMg data-wc=37>Who wouldn't want to listen to live DJs such as Becky Hill and Gok Wan or dance on the tables at Folie Douce before navigating their way back to your ski-up accommodation to change for the evening?</p><p id=eI_EhYEXvxR data-wc=53>All the stages are within walking distance from the accommodation, meaning I could easily pick and choose my favourites knowing smugly my post-festival commute was a maximum of 10 minutes. Disclaimer: I was often lost in the dark, so anyone with a decent sense of direction could shave this down to 5 minutes.</p><p id=euCa1N0Lq89H data-wc=14>This year, the setlist included The Streets, Rudimental, Nia Archives and my highlight, Goddard.</p><p id=einYK-LEFHea data-wc=48>His set was a short snowcat ride away. Insistent I was going to try and explore as much as humanly possible during my short three-day trip, I bundled into the snowcat with about 10 other festival-goers and made my bumpy way to the bottom of a ski slope.</p><p id=eOboNfuIAXkr data-wc=46>After a short (yet hilariously challenging) hike up to a remote stage, I was met with a mini outdoor bar, ice caves leading to an indoor bar and uninterrupted views of the mountain peppered with the twinkling lights of the town I had just come from.</p><h2 dir=ltr>The mountainside accommodation</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/03c15aa2ea57-snowboxx2024scottdopesnowrailjam-00613.jpg><p id=eqFRsGF13mDd data-wc=53>I'm not the kind of person who can function off a few hours of sleep. I struggle to drift off on a good day and find it even harder to stay asleep, so add in late-night dancing and drinking and early alarms to catch the first lifts and I was far from well-rested.</p><p id=e7QAKQgtdNcX data-wc=49>But that thankfully had nothing to do with my five-star mountainside accommodation, <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Premium residence L’Amara</a>. Despite being just minutes away from the live music, my apartment faced down into the valley, offering picturesque views of the Morzine valley and shielding me nicely from any noisy early morning after parties.</p><p id=eR01WchyMg8V data-wc=14>My spacious two-bedroom, three-bathroom apartment had its own kitchen, dining area, lounge and balcony.</p><p id=eKeP9V_kgJ1M data-wc=65>While the hail and snow dampened our spirits on the first morning, causing us to cancel our ski plans, my mood was quickly lifted by a pamper morning enjoying the indoor swimming pool, Hammam spa and mini sauna pods. The latter were located outside with glass walls making you feel as though you could almost touch the snow – any stress quite literally melts away.&nbsp;</p><p id=ecmKYr2m1Z4H data-wc=37>So when I say a festival ski holiday was a shock to the system, I mean in the very best sense. Would I return to Snowboxx? Absolutely. Would I be wiser with my sleep schedule?
