Additional tour dates are slated to be announced at a later date. Producer Tony Ludwig and some of the artists on the tour had this to say via press release.</p><p>Tony Ludwig: “Flower Power concerts has been doing Beatles tributes featuring some of the greatest voices and musicians available for over 20 years now, creating a unique experience that can be shared by all. The songbook of these albums should be our best one yet.”</p><p>“This time we thought: Wouldn’t it be great if we played the best songs The Beatles ever recorded for a change? ‘Rubber Soul’ and ‘Revolver’ are the boys peaking in front of our eyes and redefining what pop music would be for the foreseeable future. This is going to be fun.” – Todd Rundgren</p><p>“It’s always a pleasure playing these classic songs with great artists and friends. Please come join us.” – Christopher Cross</p><p>“The Moody Blues met the BEATLES in the early 60’s and were invited to join them on their second British tour. The thought of performing some of their classic songs with such a revered cast on this tour will bring back not only those moments in time but also fond memories as a member of WINGS. I trust that we will pay due credit to their timeless legacy by bringing back that music to everyone who joins us for this special ride.” – Denny Laine</p><p>Announced tour dates below:</p><p>March 1, 2022 – Montclair, NJ – The Wellmont Theater<br>March 2, 2022 – Pittsburgh, PA – Carnegie of Homestead Music Hall<br>March 3, 2022 – Ridgefield, CT – Ridgefield Playhouse<br>March 5, 2022 – Atlantic City, NJ – Sound Waves (Hard Rock Hotel)<br>March 6, 2022 – Westbury, NY – NYCB Theater at Westbury<br>March 7, 2022 – Red Bank, NJ – Count Basie Center for the Arts<br>March 8, 2022 – Annapolis, MD – Maryland Hall for the Creative Arts<br>March 9, 2022 – Medford, MA – Chevalier Theater<br>March 10, 2022 – Derry, NH – Tupelo Music Hall<br>March 11, 2022 – Staten Island, NY – St. George Theater<br>March 12, 2022 – Jim Thorpe, PA – Penn’s Peak<br>March 14, 2022 – Newport, KY – PromoWest Pavilion at OVATION<br>March 16, 2022 – Clearwater, FL – Ruth Eckerd Hall<br>March 17, 2022 – Tallahassee, FL – The Moon<br>March 19, 2022 – Lake Charles, LA – Golden Nugget<br>March 20, 2022 – Dallas, TX – Majestic Theater<br>March 23, 2022 – Ft.
