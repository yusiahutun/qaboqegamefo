She told Good Morning America’s, Robin Roberts, Yeah, that’s true [I’m re-recording some of my old music], and it’s something I’m very excited about doing because my contract says that starting November 2020—so next year—I can record albums 1 through 5 all over again. I’m very excited about it. Because I just think that artists deserve to own their work. I just feel very passionately about that. Yeah, it’s next year [I’ll start doing that]. It’s right around the corner. I’m going to be busy. I’m really excited.”</p><p>That’s not to say that the only things that Taylor Swift recorded since then were only re-recordings. In 2020, she released her critically acclaimed and Grammy award-winning albums evermore and folklore. She followed up with Midnights which automatically shot up to number one on the Billboard 200 chart.</p><p>So how can you get all these albums with all these cool features?
