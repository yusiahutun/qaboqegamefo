There is no reason in the world we should have to survive the holidays.

The holidays aren’t something we have to suffer through</span>—<span>they’re something we’re meant to enjoy. And I will do my best to equip you with a few of my favorite strategies for doing so.</span></p><p><span>I don’t want the single community to look back on this holiday season and feel as though they survived it. I want us to feel like we loved every second. There are twinkly lights and holiday movies and </span><i><span>pie</span></i><span> for crying out loud. This time of year is amazing!</span></p><p><span>Try to soak up every second by coming at the holidays from a place of knowing that they are all of ours to enjoy, regardless of what our relationship status may be.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AdobeStock_459948424.jpeg><h2><b>1. Prepare Your Answers</b></h2><p><span>As a single person, you are likely to hear </span><i><span>“So, are you seeeeeeeing anybodyyyyyyy?”</span></i><span> more often than Mariah Carey’s “All I Want For Christmas” during this festive holiday season. We know the questions are coming, they always do. So let’s not stress. Instead, let’s prepare a script, and learn our lines.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The biggest mistake you can make when asked this question is to answer it. Smiling through it and sweetly muttering, </span><span>“Nope, not yet!”</span><span> is a missed opportunity. Because when you actually answer this question, you let people know it’s an okay question to ask again. A better course of action is to gently, and lovingly, put the question out of its misery.</span></p><p><span>Try saying something along the lines of, “I’m actually not going to answer that question because it’s very personal to me, but I’d love to know how work is going for you!” or something to that effect. It softly suggests that the question was an unwelcome one, and deflects to another topic.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AdobeStock_293836204.jpeg><h2><b>2. Don’t Go Home!</b></h2><p><span>You laugh, but it’s better. First of all, if you love going home for <a href=# id=auto-tag_thanksgiving data-tag=thanksgiving>Thanksgiving</a>, obviously this piece of advice doesn’t pertain to you. Far be it from me to steer anyone away from something they love! </span><span>But if you don’t love Thanksgiving, if you don’t love travel nonsense, and the holiday just kind of makes you feel like you’ll spend it running into old classmates at the grocery store, I really suggest staying put. Avoidance is a game plan!</span></p><p><span>Thanksgiving hasn’t been a big deal in my family for years, and over the last few I’ve stopped telling myself that I “have to” go home for it. Now, I go slightly upstate to a friend’s house along with a rotating cast of Thanksgiving attendees. We all cook together, watch holiday movies together, and play a game called Quiplash which I must insist you look into.</span></p><p><span>It’s a 48-hour jaunt that’s incredibly manageable, and it’s about as chill as the holiday has ever been. If it stresses you out, it’s okay to sit this one out—that’s all I’m saying.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AdobeStock_300239985.jpeg><h2><b>3.&nbsp; Don’t Skip Your Friends</b></h2><p><span>Even if you do go home for the actual holiday, remember that <a href=#>Friendsgiving</a> is important. Whether you host it, go to a friend’s place (probably the friend with a dining table) or opt for a restaurant, be sure to make it a point to gather your friends during the holidays and appreciate the season together.</span></p><p><span>When we’re single, we can spend a lot of time focusing on what we don’t have (a relationship), and not enough time celebrating and expressing gratitude for what we do have—friends. Send the group text, make the plans. This is important.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AdobeStock_295940463.jpeg><h2><b>4. Start Something New</b></h2><p><span>&nbsp;Single people don’t really have events that are made just for us. And when we do, they’re literally always centered around dating, or ending what we are, as if we should focus on little else. I like the idea of starting a new tradition that celebrates singles in a genuinely fun way.</span></p><p><span>For example, this year I’m having a single women-only cocktail party at my apartment. Zero stress, zero couples, zero chance to treat the event as a place to “meet someone,” so maybe we can all just actually relax and have a good time. Everyone will be required to bring one bottle of sparkling wine and one item that could realistically be found on <a href=#>a cheese board</a>.</span></p><p><span>We’re going to build a tiny house village out of gingerbread to model the one we’ll move to when we retire. This is going to be a good time.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AdobeStock_386394333.jpeg><h2><b>5. Practice Gratitude</b></h2><p><span>&nbsp;I mean, it is Thanksgiving. I know we typically wait until January 1 to start our “I’m going to be a better person this year” song and dance, but I can’t think of a better time to take stock of everything we’re grateful for than at the start of a holiday season that loves to continually remind us of one thing we don’t have.</span></p><p><span>Locate the nearest cute notepad and commit to writing <a href=#>one thing you’re thankful</a> for on it each morning, from here until New Year’s. My guess is that, by taking account of how awesome life already is, you might also get a little clarity around bigger goals and ideas for those resolutions, too.&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/banner-newsletter_july2020.jpg alt="StyleCaster newsletter" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8uorZ5lo5rFcH2Pb2tyb2JkwKq6xqWcZpmkYsGprc2kqqChpp67qHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
