No one has been named a person of interest, and no arrest has been made in connection with the disappearance, Chipman said.</p><p>Rubenstein’s full name is Sandra Ernestine Simmons Rubenstein, Chipman said. Rubenstein left behind her cell phone, purse and car, Chipman said.</p><p>Chipman’s husband, she said, “is pretty strong, but he’s having a hard time. He wants some answers. Someone has to know something.”</p><p>Anyone who sees Rubenstein or has any information about her disappearance should call their local law-enforcement agency or 911, said Chipman. She advises that instead of approaching her, anyone who sees Rubenstein should call law enforcement instead.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaJ2apZmhxm67xWakoqujnruoedaao5ynpKl6uLvMmqVmq5WauLR5x56jqWWWp7yuec%2BumaWhk2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
