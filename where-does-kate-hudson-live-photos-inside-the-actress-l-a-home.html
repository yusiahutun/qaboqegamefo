In 2011, the <a href=#>How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days</a> actress purchased the mansion next door so she could make room for her family. In case you were wondering, photos of the home certainly don’t do it justice.</p><p>Kate’s immaculate property holds a lot of significance as she still lives in the home her mom, <a href=#><strong>Goldie Hawn</strong></a>, purchased in 1979. After becoming an established Hollywood star in the early 2000s, the Almost Famous alum bought her childhood home for $5.5 million. At the time she became the owner of the home next door, it was valued at $5.3 million.</p><p>The <a href=#>Golden Globe</a> winner’s living quarters are quite impressive as it features seven bedrooms, multiple bathrooms, a massive backyard with a pool and spa and much more. As for her 1935 Tudor Revival home, which Kate uses as a guest house, it’s fitted with five bedrooms and six-and-a-half bathrooms.</p><p>It’s not rare to catch glimpses inside Kate’s home as she often shares photos hanging out with her fiancé, <a href=#><strong>Danny Fujikawa</strong></a>, their daughter, <a href=#>Rani Rosie Fujikawa</a>, and her two sons, Ryder Robinson and Bingham Bellamy, whom she shares with men from previous relationships.</p><p>While being the owner of two mansions sounds like a lot, it seems Kate makes great use out of it as a busy actress, businesswoman and mom of three kids. The Bride Wars actress — who was previously married to ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Chris Robinson</strong></a> and engaged to ex-fiancé <a href=#><strong>Matt Bellamy</strong></a> — even dished she might not be done having kiddos.</p><p>“I have a feeling I’m probably going to end up winning,” the Raising Helen&nbsp;star joked about the possibility of having more kids than her older brother, <a href=#><strong>Oliver Hudson</strong></a>, who shares his three children with wife <strong>Erinn Bartlett</strong>, during an appearance on <a href=#>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a> in February 2020. “I don’t know if I’m done yet.”</p><p>After welcoming her youngest child, Rani, in October 2018, Kate — who <a href=#>announced her engagement</a> with Danny in September 2021 — sweetly admitted she might have a case of baby fever. “Right now, Rani’s in that place where you’re like, ‘I want another baby,’” she said. “But once she gets like 4 or 5, you’re like, ‘I feel like my life is kinda back a little bit. They’re kind of in a groove.’ There’s like a window.”</p><p><strong>In the meantime, scroll through the gallery below to see photos inside her home!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn56qlWKxsLHSZqKarJVitbaw0qilZqSZq7JuvMeoq6irXZ67tLXDnmStoJVirqTA0Z6qrGWcYq5utM6mnGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
