Whether you’ve been clipping into skis since before you could practically walk or are planning on hitting the slopes for the very first time this year, you’re going to want to have the right gear. Once you have boots, skis or a board and a helmet, you get to have a little fun with your ensemble. Skip the boring black jackets and opt for a <a href=# rel=noopener>cute ski jacket</a> instead—I promise that adding a little pattern to your puffer won’t make it any less warm.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>This year, it seems like fashion brands are in agreement that the literal coolest place to make a statement is on the slopes. In the last month, many major brands have released <a href=# rel=noopener>exclusive ski collections</a> which is great news for you if you’re in the market for a new jacket. LoveShackFancy teamed up with Bogner to create a floral winter wonderland of performance ski gear, Farm Rio released tropical retro-inspired ski suits and even Zara has a more budget-friendly ski collection.</p><p>When shopping for a ski jacket, there are a few criteria that are important to consider. First, check if the jacket is waterproof and windproof—you’ll thank yourself for this when you’re on a cold chairlift in a snowstorm. Second, make sure you can comfortably move in your ensemble, even with multiple layers underneath it. There is nothing worse than spending the day uncomfortable and adjusting your outfit. And finally, you’ll want to pick a jacket you will be happy to <a href=# rel=noopener>wear for multiple seasons</a>. Ski gear is expensive and most people pick a suit and stick with it for multiple seasons.</p><p>That being said, there are so many great ski jacket options on the market right now so you really can’t go wrong with your choice.</p><p>Keep scrolling for ski jackets that are just as fashionable as they are functional. See you on the slopes!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-14-at-2.16.04-PM.png><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>This jacket</a> does a little bit of everything. It features a waterproof layer over the jacket’s quilted interior that can easily be removed once you’re out of the snow. The sleeves also zipper off so you’ll be able to wear it as a vest.
