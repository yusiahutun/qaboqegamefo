In fact, your body temperature might be one of the best metrics for assessing your metabolism (thyroid)&nbsp;and overall health. For optimal health, your body temperature should be around 98.6 degrees.&nbsp; Your body can and will deviate from this temperature if it feels the need&nbsp;(i.e. a fever&nbsp;is produced as a means to fight an infection). I write this only so you understand how important your body temperature is and as an introduction to tell you about&nbsp;two&nbsp;therapies which use hot and cold to support optimal health and longevity. These therapies are infrared saunas and cryotherapy. I call them therapies&nbsp;because they can have a strong therapeutic affect on the body and mind&nbsp;when used regularly.&nbsp;When it comes to health, the basics definitely go a long way. But life isn't always basic and sometimes there are benefits to using more advanced therapies&nbsp;such as these. The benefits of&nbsp; both are remarkably similar:</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="p1 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">THE BENEFITS OF INFRARED SAUNAS AND CRYOTHERAPY</p><ul data-node-id=4 class="ul1 css-yzf9pi emevuu60"><li>Improved detoxification via the skin and lymphatic system.</li><li>Improvements in blood circulation to heart and other critical organs (i.e digestive system).</li><li>Accelerated recovery from exercise which can lead to&nbsp;increased lean muscle.</li><li>Improvements in your bodies ability to regulate&nbsp;body&nbsp;temperature&nbsp;(remember how important this is).</li><li>Improvements in skin quality.</li><li>Improvements in blood sugar regulation (insulin sensitivity).</li><li>Reduction in pain and inflammation.</li><li>Increased longevity.</li><li>Improved sleep.</li><li>Improved ability to adapt to stress and strengthening of the&nbsp;autonomic&nbsp;nervous system.</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="p1 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">CRYOTHERAPY</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="p1 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I have long been an advocate of cold showers, cold ocean plunges&nbsp;and ice baths as a means of supporting optimal health and longevity, but recently I was introduced to&nbsp;cryotherapy.&nbsp;My first thought when I heard the term Cryotherapy was Walt Disney.&nbsp; But Cryotherapy,&nbsp;not to be confused with&nbsp;cryonics,&nbsp;utilizes high tech looking machines that produce extreme cold temperatures (-200 Fahrenheit) via nitrogen gas. You stand in the unit in your&nbsp;underwear, gloves and rubber boots for a period of 3 minutes before stepping out into a plush robe.&nbsp; The obvious benefits are in the area&nbsp;of&nbsp;reducing pain/inflammation and supporting recovery.&nbsp;The cold can certainly help with that. More important in my mind is the ability to reduce stress. It does this on both the physical and mental level. Physically, cryotherapy tricks the body into&nbsp;protecting your critical organs. It&nbsp;does this by&nbsp;moving oxygen rich blood from your extremities to your organs.&nbsp;Most people spend quite a bit of time in a &nbsp;stressed state (fight or flight state). When in this state, blood flow is concentrated in your extremities&nbsp;keeping you mobilized to face whatever stressors come your way.&nbsp;This leaves critical organs and organ systems (like the digestive system)&nbsp;with limited blood flow.&nbsp;The intense cold tricks your body into protecting your organs&nbsp;as they are perceived as more important than&nbsp;your arms and legs.&nbsp; Mentally, the intense cold can stimulate a parasympathetic or mind quieting response.&nbsp;This is extremely beneficial for people who are&nbsp;constantly thinking and analyzing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="p1 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Where to Try:</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="p1 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Cryotherapy is still relatively new to the scene and there are not many around. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://driveclubs.com/cryo/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Drive 495" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Drive 495</a>&nbsp;in NYC has recently installed a unit which is available to the public.&nbsp;And if you can't get to a machine, cold showers are free.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="p1 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>How to incorporate in your routine:</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="p1 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Daily following an&nbsp;injury or period of hard training.

It also just feels&nbsp;good to "bathe" in the heat.&nbsp; The idea with both are very simple—heat a dark or dimly lit room&nbsp;(with or without steam) and your body temperature will eventually&nbsp;rise&nbsp;enough to&nbsp;trigger a&nbsp;sweat. In the process most people tend to enter a state of relaxation.&nbsp;Room temperatures of greater than 180 degrees are usually required for this process to happen. These temps usually limit standard sauna sessions to 10-15 minutes and you can sometimes feel quite drained when you step out.&nbsp;Enter Infared saunas: They are quite different in that&nbsp;the focus of the heat is not the room, but your body. This is accomplished through infrared panels which are installed in the sauna room. These panels produce waves of energy (infrared&nbsp;waves) which penetrate your body and increase your body temperature. The fact that your body is heated directly usually means that you can achieve a deep sweat at a much lower room temperature&nbsp;(120 - 140&nbsp;degrees)&nbsp;and&nbsp;that you can stay in the sauna for a longer period of time.&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="p1 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lauren&nbsp;Berlingeri from <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.higherdoseinfrared.com_&d=CwMFaQ&c=B73tqXN8Ec0ocRmZHMCntw&r=4kKDj2OAvERZJnMpKpKyiguEfi-jx_PUTmjrV1EjHLk&m=DvwfA-UD4IFjCifeRV_dUnoLih9AV1oRvpPW-vIArHs&s=fhJAYVK76zQDbue0ANnf90GgYhyLW65AsW82Bim-BtQ&e=" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=HigherDose class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">HigherDose</a> says :&nbsp;"When constrained for time, infrared saunas might be the most efficient use of 30 minutes as you are addressing&nbsp;and&nbsp;supporting&nbsp;all layers of your health, from&nbsp;the mind to the &nbsp;body."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="p1 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Where to&nbsp;Try:</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="p1 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Infrared Saunas are popping up in more <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__theherbanalchemist.com_&d=CwMFaQ&c=B73tqXN8Ec0ocRmZHMCntw&r=4kKDj2OAvERZJnMpKpKyiguEfi-jx_PUTmjrV1EjHLk&m=DvwfA-UD4IFjCifeRV_dUnoLih9AV1oRvpPW-vIArHs&s=UO8bzftI7PBpT9SuW8UVaMje4fZqH5NGgsbKicj7ECo&e=" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="wellness center s" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">wellness center s</a>and high end gyms.&nbsp;They can&nbsp;also be considered for installation in your home, office&nbsp;or apartment.
