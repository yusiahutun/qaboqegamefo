Stories have surfaced that included both his dad and his mom following the actor’s sudden death.</p><p>This piece is about Angus Cloud’s parents Lisa and Conor.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Angus Cloud Parents?</strong></h3><p>Actor Angus Cloud was close to his parents and his two siblings. His untimely death at the age of 25 has immensely saddened his fans and his family members. The tragedy occurred less than two weeks after Angus lost the patriarch of the Hickey household.</p><p>Angus was one of the three children of Lisa Cloud and Conor Hickey.</p><p>Cloud’s surviving family released a statement to TMZ regarding his death. <span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em>In it, they said: “It is with the heaviest heart that we had to say goodbye to an incredible human today. As an artist, a friend, a brother, and a son, Angus was special to all of us in so many ways.</span></p><p>“Last week he buried his father and intensely struggled with this loss. The only comfort we have is knowing Angus is now reunited with his dad, who was his best friend. Angus was open about his battle with mental health and we hope that his passing can be a reminder to others that they are not alone and should not fight this on their own in silence.”</p><p>The statement concluded: “We hope the world remembers him for his humor, laughter, and love for everyone. We ask for privacy at this time as we are still processing this devastating loss.”</p><p>Born on 10 July 1998, Angus hailed from Oakland, California, USA. He was best known for Euphoria (2019),&nbsp;Your Lucky Day,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Untitled Monster Thriller for Universal Pictures Project (2024). He died on July 31, 2023, in Oakland, California, USA.</p><p>Prior to his passing, Angus shared how difficult it was to portray a drug dealer on television while still going through his own personal issues. “Sympathy, yo. Because addiction is serious and a lot of doctors call it a disease, it’s a real thing. People don’t understand it. It’s easy to talk about and it’s easy to say, ‘Just say no,’” he told <a href=# rel=noopener>Complex</a> in February 2022. “But for someone who is in active addiction, that is damn near impossible and they will throw their whole life away and they will die because of this disease or whatever, and then they will say it’s not a disease because you ‘choose’ to do drugs. You don’t ‘choose’ to do cancer.”</p><p>One month ago, Angus had stated that as he continued in Hollywood, he hoped to broaden his résumé and work on a number of different projects. “I want to keep making cool projects and just keep being a part of just making cool art,” Angus told <a href=# rel=noopener>GQ</a> in January 2022. “I’m a pretty goofy guy in real life, so it’d be fun to try and see If I could bring that goofiness to the camera.”</p><p>He noted: “Also I want to be in something like [Fantastic Four]. I want to do some [Harry Potter-esque] ‘Wingardium Leviosa.’ I’m ready for it all man. There’s like infinite universes that you can be a part of.”</p><h3><strong>Meet Conor Hickey, Angus Cloud Father</strong></h3><p>TMZ first reported that a source close to the family revealed to the outlet that Angus Cloud was struggling with his father’s unexpected death. The source revealed, “tells us Angus had been battling severe suicidal thoughts after getting back from Ireland, where they laid his father to rest. We’re told he was staying with his family as he tried to work through overcoming the grief.”</p><p>Conor was 65 years old at the time of his death. He was likely working as a Senior Director of Customer Success at Workboard Inc. Conor graduated from University College Cork in Cork, Ireland. Hence, he was of Irish-American heritage.</p><p>According to his wife, Conor passed away from cancer. US Weekly reports that Conor died of a short illness. Angus posted the above picture to IG captioning, “Miss u, breh.” He was taken back to Ireland for the burial.</p><h3><strong>Meet Lisa Cloud, Angus Cloud Mother</strong></h3><p>Angus Cloud’s mother is named Lisa Cloud. After his death, a few stories about Angus and his family surfaced on social media. When Angus was still a young teen, he plunged into a 10-foot-deep construction pit and broke his head and fingers. Amazingly, he made it through and climbed out. He took the bus to his mother’s house even though he wasn’t bleeding but could see his vision was foggy.</p><p>“She thought I was on drugs, ’cause my pupils was hella dilated,” Angus told <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety&nbsp;</a>in 2022. “I was trying to tell her what happened, but I could only start a sentence — I couldn’t finish it. So I was like, ‘I’m just gonna go sleep in my bed.’”</p><p>His mother took him to the children’s hospital because she didn’t believe letting him go to sleep was a wise idea. His life was saved by that choice. He underwent skull surgery to help fuse it back together and spent five days healing there.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6 data-skm-boomerang-el-9=processed>“That’s what the scar’s from. They cut my head open, they put some screws and a plate over where I broke my skull … me back up, and that was that,” the actor said nonchalantly.</p>In 2023, Lisa was unable to save her son. Oakland Police later revealed to TMZ that Angus’s mother dialed 911 on Monday morning at about 11:30 am to report a “possible overdose.” Angus had no pulse, she claimed over the phone. The actor was pronounced deceased at the site by emergency personnel. On 11 July 2023, Lisa wished her son, “Happy birthday to the best son in the whole wide world!!” She was a proud mother and posted a lot about her son.<p><span style=font-weight:400>About Lisa, she was born in Santa Barbara, California to prominent American earth scientist, biogeologist, cosmologist, and paleontologist Preston Cloud Jr. (who coined the term Hadean Eon) and Frances Webster Cloud. </span><span style=font-weight:400>Lisa’s mother was born to Texas-German sharecroppers as the youngest of 11. She joined the US Geological Survey as a clerical worker.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>&nbsp;</span><span style=font-weight:400>Lisa and Preston met during the USGS’s ‘post-hostilities mineral mapping’ mission on the island of Saipan in the late ’40s. After their amicable 1965 divorce, she joined the staff at the UCSB geology department where she eventually served as Business Officer for 4 different department chairs. She also raised her demented hippie sisters and her brother Kevin during the ’60s and ’70s in a beautiful house in the Santa Barbara foothills where she ended her days full of years in January of 2001.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>&nbsp;</span><span style=font-weight:400>Lisa was an actress who appeared in various TV shows and films.
