Gone are the days of going to the local bridal shop to pick abridesmaid dress—and I couldn’t be happier. No offense to traditional bridal boutiques, but they don’t make it easy to find your dream dress, and they can involve a few weeks of alterations all to end up with a cookie cutter dress that costs a few hundred bucks."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

No offense to traditional bridal boutiques, but they don’t make it easy to find your dream dress, and they can involve a few weeks of alterations all to end up with a cookie cutter dress that costs a few hundred bucks. If there’s one<a href=#> wedding trend</a> that’s here to stay, it’s giving bridesmaids the power to choose their own dress style. Just because it’s not your big day doesn’t mean you should settle for something that doesn’t make you feel all sparkly inside.&nbsp;</p><p>As a shopping writer and a 2023 maid of honor, I’ve basically become an expert in shopping for online bridesmaid dresses. Sure, the color scheme is set, but now I have to find a dress that fits like a glove on my unique body type and is an extension of my personal style.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>These important choices are why<a href=#> shopping for a bridesmaid dress</a> online is so. much. better. than it used to be. But where do you start? I’ve religiously scoured just about every online boutique in hopes of finding a dreamy dress that doesn’t cost a fortune. The following sites are the best places to order a bridesmaid dress online, based on their unique silhouettes, inclusive sizes,&nbsp; price options and ease of returning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.3136882129278><h2>Azazie&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/azazie-bridesmaid-dress.jpg><p>If a timeless twist on classic bridesmaid dress styles is your cup of tea, then<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> Azazie</a> is right up your alley. Azazie narrows the hunt with options to filter by color, material, and special considerations, like if you’re shopping for a maternity dress or something more modest. Plus, you don’t have to commit to the dress in order to<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> try it on at home</a>. For just $20, you can choose 1-3 bridesmaids dresses to try on in the comfort of your own home. If you find your dream dress, Azazie offers a 10% discount on your final pick. Even after filtering for the color burgundy and dresses with thicker straps/sleeves for my sister’s winter wedding, I still have plenty of options to choose from. I also love that I can try them on before paying full price.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.781954887218><h2>Lulus</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lulus-bridesmaid-dress.jpg><p>If you’re a young Millennial like me, you’re no stranger to<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#> Lulus</a> for trendy and affordable fashion. Lulus debuted their size inclusive bridal boutique in 2020 to improve the experience of shopping for bridal gowns and bridesmaid dresses.

I personally love the peace of mind that comes with shopping on Lulus. If your dress isn’t exactly what you imagined, returns are totally free and you’ll get your money back so long as it’s sent back within 30 days. Bonus: Lulus has amazing<a href=#> heels</a> for the big day, too.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.40159574468085><h2>Birdy Grey</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/birdy-grey-dress.jpg><p><a href=#>Bridesmaid dresses under $100</a>? Count me in!<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> Birdy Grey</a> practically invented affordable bridesmaid dresses for every body type and offers all the classic and trendy colorways imaginable—even the hard-to-shop-for ones like<a href=#> gray bridesmaid dresses</a>. If your style leans chic and classic, Birdy Grey is the ideal destination for traditional satin and chiffon bridesmaid dresses that are always $99 or lower. Oh and if you’re a bride-to-be, Birdy Grey offers beautiful<a href=#> bridesmaid gifts</a> like matching satin pajamas or<a href=#> robes</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.9557564224548><h2>Anthropologie</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bhldn-dress.jpg><p>Oh, Anthropologie. Our favorite destination for stunning<a href=#> gifts</a> and<a href=#> home goods</a> also has an unbeatable bridal line:<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> BHLDN</a>. If you’re not into traditional bridesmaid dress silhouettes, Anthropologie’s BHLDN line of dreamy gowns are unmatched. Though you may have to sacrifice your under $150 budget, you’ll make up for it with a dress that’ll be the talk of the wedding—right next to the bride’s show-stopping gown, of course. I personally love the range of silhouettes on BHLDN, whether you want to keep it classic with a satin gown or throw tradition out the window with a fun print. Speaking of, if you’re a bride dreaming of<a href=# rel=nofollow> mix and matched bridesmaid</a> dresses that don’t look, well, super DIY, BHLDN makes it easy to bring your vision to life by showing what materials, colors, print and silhouettes mesh fabulously together. If the fit isn’t perfect, you can expect a full refund so long as the dress is returned in its original packaging within 30 days.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.7354618015964><h2>ASOS</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/asos-bridesmaid-dress.jpg><p>The best part of shopping for a bridesmaid dress online is that it doesn’t technically have to be a bridesmaid dress. So long as it fits the bride’s vision and color scheme, the options are endless. ASOS offers the best of both worlds with a dedicated<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#> bridesmaid shop</a> and hundreds of non-traditional dress options beyond it. While their color palettes are a bit more subdued, you can expect a range of styles from bold to clean silhouettes. I mean, how dreamy is this<a rel=nofollow href=#> sheer tulle midi bridesmaid dress</a>? Prices are well under $200 and a full refund is possible as long as the dress is returned within 28 days. If you’re on a tight budget or just can’t commit to a dress, you can also rent plenty of pretty styles straight through ASOS just in time for the big day. The same goes for<a href=#> wedding guest dresses</a>, too!</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.9086859688196><h2>Reformation</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/reformation-bridesmaid-dress.jpg><p>For splurge-worthy bridesmaid dresses, turn to<a href=# rel=nofollow> Reformation</a> for sustainable gowns you’ll want to wear to every single wedding on your calendar—even if you’re not in the bridal party.
