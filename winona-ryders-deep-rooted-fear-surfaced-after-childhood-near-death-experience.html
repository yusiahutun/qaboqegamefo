Looking back at her performance, Winono admitted: ”I was terrified to play a character who was full of fear and anxiety knowing that I have been full of fear and anxiety, and it’s not something that’s just past tense for me. It’s something you battle with your whole life.”</p><p>Winona also talked about how the role made her go to a really dark place as she portrayed on-screen anxiety attacks. ”To play an anxiety attack, you have to get an anxiety attack. And I didn’t know how to put a lid on that when they said ‘cut,”’ Winona adds sharing, ”my heart would still be going a million miles an hour, and I would be sweating and I would feel like I felt when I was 19 and felt totally alone and couldn’t describe to anyone in the world how I was feeling.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-906553-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-winona-s-near-death-experience>Winona’s near-death experience</h2><p>Winona faced a near-death experience when she was only 12 where she almost drowned. The traumatic experience with water caused the Little Women actress to be fearful of water and later, her underwater scenes in&nbsp;Alien: Resurrection&nbsp;(1997) required multiple re-takes. More concerningly, the technical difficulties in the scenes also made the filming more of a struggle for her.</p><p>Speaking of her trauma, Winona <a href=# rel=nofollow>shared</a>: “When I was 12 years old, I technically died drowning,” adding, “When they pulled me out of the water, I didn’t have a pulse.</p><p>“So the underwater stuff was especially bad for me. It was really terrifying,” Winona confessed also revealing: “I’m not cured. I still don’t think I’ll ever go in the ocean again.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlxX2eDcMPIp6anmV2nxqWx0axknZ2VpXqzu86tnJ1llpqus3nSrqmfmZOasW6txa2cq2WTnbatsMeopp1lnpqus3nDnpitoF2axbGx0aKcp5uVZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
