And pairing blue heels with your navy blue dress is the perfect recipe to do just that! When it comes to pairing the two together, it's all about creating a cohesive and balanced look.&nbsp;</p><p>If your vibe is completely monochromatic, you can choose different shades and textures of blue to create visual interest. Pair a navy blue dress with cobalt blue heels to create a bold and sophisticated look, or create contrast by adding neutral elements to the outfit such as a beige clutch for a chic and understated look. In both these options, the blue heels will stand out as the statement piece, and draw the eyes downward from the dress to the footwear. For an elegant look opt for an A-line or shift silhouette, that is elegant and chic. And for a more feminine and playful approach, opt for a fit-and-flare dress paired with pumps.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>Either way, make sure you consider the occasion when choosing the silhouette, as some dress styles may be more appropriate for certain events than others. Also, make sure you keep promotions in mind while picking shoes that go with navy blue dresses. Choosing heels that are too high or bulky can throw off the balance of the outfit, so opt for heels that are comfortable and complement the dress silhouette.</p><h3 id=66055384743ce><strong>2. Black</strong></h3><p><img alt="What Color Shoes Go with Navy Blue Dresses" title="What Color Shoes Go with Navy Blue Dresses" width=1000 height=755 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-05/1684321975_shutterstock_2207223687.jpg></p><p>Black heels are a timeless combination that looks good with almost any color dress. They're sophisticated and chic, and look extremely put together when styled well. When paired with a navy blue dress, the two can create a stunning unified and finished look.&nbsp;</p><p>A sleek and refined look can be achieved with classic pumps or strappy sandals, while an edge can be added with tougher types like studded boots. Think about combining<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","What Color Shoes Go with Navy Blue Dresses: 11 Cool Combinations","1221508","https://www.pinkvilla.com/lifestyle/home-decor","articlepage","/fashion/style-tips/what-color-shoes-go-with-navy-blue-dresses-1221508"," accessories","Body_Hyperlink","fashion","style-tips")'> accessories</a> in other colors, such as a metallic clutch or statement jewelry, to add contrast and visual interest to the ensemble. However, it is crucial to avoid over-accessorizing, which might overpower the look and take away from the dress and heels.&nbsp;</p><p>Also since both colors are darker and can often blend, consider subtly adding a third color when pairing black shoes with a navy dress, via a belt or a scarf with a pattern, to balance the ensemble.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, as mentioned before, remember to keep the occasion and dress code into account. This color combination is ideal for more formal occasions, which call for a classier outfit. With careful styling and attention to detail, a navy blue dress with black shoes may make for an exquisite and timeless ensemble.</p><h3 id=66055384743d4><strong>3. White&nbsp;</strong></h3><p><img alt=" Color shoes go navy blue dress" title=" Color shoes go navy blue dress" width=667 height=1000 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-05/1684322000_shutterstock_1922712734.jpg></p><p>White is another neutral that is super sophisticated, chic, and stunning. However, to make this combination work, it's essential to pay attention to the shades and textures of the pieces.&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to white heels, opting for a sleek, minimalist design can help keep the focus on the dress. A pointed-toe stiletto or a simple strappy sandal can elongate the legs and add a touch of elegance. To complement the navy blue dress, consider adding white accessories, such as a statement necklace or clutch, to tie the look together. A pop of red lipstick can also add a playful touch of color to the otherwise neutral-based outfit.&nbsp;</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>Moreover, when choosing a navy dress to pair with white, it's important to consider the tone and texture of the fabric. A silky or flowy material can create a more romantic feel, while a structured or tailored style can add a touch of sophistication. When it comes to shades, a darker navy blue can pair well with bright white heels, while a lighter shade of navy blue can look great with off-white or ivory heels.&nbsp;</p><p>For a formal event, a floor-length navy blue gown with white heels can create an elegant and polished look, while a knee-length navy blue dress with white heels can be perfect for a daytime event or a more casual occasion. Overall, styling a navy blue dress with white heels can create a stylish and timeless look that is perfect for a variety of occasions.</p><h3 id=66055384743d9><strong>4. Gold&nbsp;</strong></h3><p><img alt="What Color Shoes Go with Navy Blue Dresses" title="What Color Shoes Go with Navy Blue Dresses" width=511 height=1000 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-05/1684322021_shutterstock_166147604.jpg></p><p>Moving away from the neutrals and on to more glamorous and metallic shades, next we have gold! A navy blue dress with gold heels can produce a beautiful and glitzy appearance.&nbsp;</p><p>Strappy gold heels look glitzy and while a navy blue dress looks more put together, bringing together the perfect balance. Chunky gold shoes can give a shorter navy blue dress some edge and give off a more fun feel.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember to take into account the undertones of the navy blue dress while choosing color combinations. A coherent and well-balanced appearance can be achieved by wearing a navy blue dress with gold heels that have a cooler metallic finish if the dress has cooler undertones. On the other hand, wearing a navy blue dress with gold heels that have a warmer metallic finish can result in a harmonious and fashionable ensemble if the dress has warmer undertones. Accessorizing with gold jewelry can highlight the gold highlights in the clothing to give it more depth and provide a more put together and fashionable appearance. The gold heels can also be enhanced by adding a small gold necklace or a pair of spectacular gold earrings.</p><h3 id=66055384743de><strong>5. Silver</strong></h3><p><img alt="What Color Shoes Go with Navy Blue Dresses" title="What Color Shoes Go with Navy Blue Dresses" width=1280 height=1920 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-05/1684322041_pexels-victoria-rain-5184319.jpg></p><p>Another metallic shade to keep in mind when deciding what shoes to wear with a navy dress is silver. Silver is fun, yet glamorous. It's cool yet not casual. And it also makes a statement. A pair of silver strappy heels are exactly what one needs to add some shine and sophistication to a navy blue dress.&nbsp;</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>To balance out the look, one can accessorize with silver jewelry such as a necklace or earrings in the same shade. If you want to add some additional color to the outfit, you can add a statement silver clutch as well to complete the look.&nbsp;</p><p>For a formal event, a long navy blue dress with a fitted silhouette can be paired with silver stiletto heels to create a sleek and sophisticated look. Alternatively, a navy blue midi dress with a flowy, feminine silhouette can be paired with silver block heels to create a more casual and playful look.&nbsp;</p><p>It's important to keep in mind that the key to pairing navy blue with silver is to keep the overall look simple and sophisticated. Avoid pairing too many prints or patterns, and instead focus on finding accessories that complement the color and style of the dress. With the right styling and attention to detail, a navy blue dress with silver heels can make for the perfect outfit.</p><h3><strong>6. Brown</strong></h3><p><img alt="What Color Shoes Go with Navy Blue Dresses" title="What Color Shoes Go with Navy Blue Dresses" width=1000 height=667 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-05/1684322061_shutterstock_222480928.jpg></p><p>Going back to the neutrals, we have the safest option of the lot, brown.

We suggest a toned-down, subtler version of the dark chocolate brown mentioned above, beige is a simple classic that one can turn to when confused.&nbsp;</p><p>For a classic and chic look, opt for a beige heel that matches the blue as closely as possible in terms of shading to create the illusion of elongated legs.

Strappy or pointed-toe pumps can add a touch of elegance and femininity, while chunky or platform heels can create more modern energy.&nbsp;</p><p>It is important to select the right shade of yellow to ensure the colors do not clash.
