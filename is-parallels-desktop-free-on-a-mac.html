It works on everything from Apple Silicon models with the M1 or M2 chip to older Intel Macs, plus the setup process is easy. So are there any free versions of Parallels Desktop or discounts available?</p><h2 id=is-parallels-desktop-free>Is Parallels Desktop Free?</h2><p><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Parallels Desktop</a> for Mac is a premium app, which means the full version is not available for free. The standard version of Parallels Desktop 18 starts at $99.99 for the home and student edition, which is a single one-off payment that gives you access to 8GB of <a href=#>VRAM</a>, 4 virtual <a href=#>CPUs</a>, and 30 days of phone and email support.</p><p>You can also buy the Pro Edition of Parallels Desktop for $119 per year, which ups the VRAM to 128GB and virtual CPU count to 32 alongside some other nice extras like a Virtual Studio plugin, advanced networking tools, better sorting for your VM, and 24/7 phone and email support. Beyond this, there's a Business edition for $149.99 per year which adds features geared toward enterprise users.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can compare these editions on the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Parallels Desktop website</a>. All versions of Parallels Desktop let you install and run Windows, Linux, and macOS as long as your underlying hardware is compatible. Mac users with an Apple Silicon machine can <a href=#>download and install Windows 11 on ARM from within Parallels Desktop</a>.</p><p>Parallels offers <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">discounts for students and educators</a> with a 50% price drop on the Standard and Pro editions. You'll need to verify you're a student before you can claim the discount. This discount is only available on a Parallels Desktop subscription, there's no half-price one-off purchase for the Standard edition.</p><p>Parallels also offers <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">discounts for active military members</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">government employees</a>, and <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">charity and nonprofit employees</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Best Tech Discounts and Deals for College Students</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-to-download-parallels-desktop-for-free-14-day-trial>How to Download Parallels Desktop for Free (14-Day Trial)</h2><p>Download Parallels Desktop for free from the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Parallels Desktop trial page</a>. During installation, you'll be asked to activate Parallels Desktop, at which point you can click on the "Try Free for 14 days" button at the bottom of the window to delay payment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/parallels_free_trial.png><p>This gives you two weeks to try the software out. You can download and install various operating systems (including Windows), optimize VMs for gaming or other tasks or manually tweak virtual hardware setups, and install any software you want to make sure that the app does everything you expect it to.</p><p>Once your 14 days are up the app will notify you that the trial period has ended and allow you to upgrade from a trial to the full version. You'll be able to keep any virtual machines you've created once you upgrade. Alternatively, you can <a href=#>uninstall Parallels Desktop as you would any other Mac app</a> to get the space back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-best-free-alternatives-to-parallels-desktop>The Best Free Alternatives to Parallels Desktop</h2><p>Parallels Desktop isn't the only virtual machine app for Mac, but it's one of the easiest to use. When you buy Parallels you're paying for a smooth setup process, superior <a href=#>3D acceleration</a> within your VMs, and the general ease of use that other virtualization apps forego.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/parallels_desktop_download_windows.png><p><a href=#>VMware Fusion</a>&nbsp;now <a href=#>supports Windows on Apple Silicon Mac models</a>, with a free version called <a href=#>VMware Fusion Player</a> available for non-commercial usage. This allows you to run Windows on your Mac just like Parallels Desktop, though the <a href=#>setup process is far more hands-on</a> and requires some work on your part.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another option is Oracle's longstanding free virtual machine software <a href=#>VirtualBox</a>. The application was <a href=#>updated in late 2022 to add support for Apple Silicon chips</a>, though at the time of writing this functionality is still limited to the developer preview build.</p><h2 id=alternatively-don-t-run-windows-at-all>Alternatively, Don't Run Windows At All</h2><p>There are other options for <a href=#>running Windows apps on your Mac that don't involve a virtual machine</a>. These include using <a href=#>Wine via the Wineskin Winery app</a>&nbsp;or using a <a href=#>premium wrapper app called CrossOver</a>.</p><p>Don't forget that running Windows in a virtual machine still technically requires a Windows license, even for the ARM version of Windows 11. You can <a href=#>install and use Windows 11 without a license</a> as long as you're happy with Microsoft withholding some features and bugging you to activate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhvcHFjbIZwtdJmp5qqkaG5prjSZpueq5upvLF5xaucnmWfo3qiecyammg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
