If you recall, this lunar cycle began with encouragement to get organized, focused and disciplined, courtesy of that Virgo New Moon. Perhaps you spent the beginning of the month making plans, setting intentions or working towards the next step in your journey to get closer to your dreams.</span></p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/askawitch_question4_FI.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/askawitch_question3.jpg><p><span>Now, with the lunar cycle peaking at this Pisces Full Moon, it’s time to take a pause, reflect on any feedback the universe has provided and release anything that might be disconnecting you from the mindset or emotional space necessary to manifest where you want to be.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>A special note about this full moon</span>—<span>a Pisces Full Moon can pull you all the way into your feelings and emotions. This, of course, can go one of two ways. You can be pulled into a deeper appreciation and respect for yourself, or a place of self-loathing. It’s really up to you to choose how you wish to use this magnetic energy.</span></p><p><span>Spending time journaling, <a href=#>meditating</a> or doing breathing exercises on the night of the full moon is a sure way to keep the energy high. If you find that your energy starts waning, make a gratitude list! It’s a sure-fire way to prevent full moon spiraling.</span></p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1><p>A Pisces Full Moon can pull you all the way into your feelings and emotions.</p></figure><p><span>Fortunately, Pluto will be throwing some friendly vibes to this full moon, supporting the transformation necessary for you to truly honor your inner power. Neptune, however, could make interpreting your feelings a little hazy. Maybe this time, instead of trying to rationalize your emotions, you just let them flow, honor them and release them. Doing <a href=#>something creative</a> or artistic might help you connect with your unconscious a little more, too.</span></p><p><span>The last thing to note about this Full Moon in Pisces is that it is tied to the Pisces New Moon that occurred back on March 13, 2021. Check your calendar or journal to see what types of goals or intentions you set then, or what projects you started around that time. This full moon will bring you feedback from or even culminate whatever you were working on.</span></p><p><span>If you love the results, amazing! If you don’t, that’s okay too. Be gentle with yourself—you are closer than you think to achieving whatever you desire.&nbsp;</span></p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1.5><p>Be gentle with yourself, you are closer than you think to achieving whatever you desire.</p></figure><p><span>As you use this full moon to reflect, integrate and course-correct, </span><span>Scorpio, Capricorn, Pisces, Cancer and Taurus will feel this moon’s energy in the most encouraging way.</span><span> Use the opportunity wisely and dream big dreams, lovers!</span></p><p><span>To Gemini, Virgo and Sagittarius: Be gentle with yourselves. You might not love the floaty feeling of <a href=#>your emotions</a>, but it is truly your emotions that create your reality. Honoring them only makes your powers to manifest stronger.</span></p><p><span>Observe your feelings, settle into them without the fear of them overtaking you. Use your natural power to be grounded as you let said emotions flow through you. Staying stuck helps no one.&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/banner-newsletter_july2020.jpg alt="StyleCaster newsletter" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8uorZ5lo5rFcH2Ra25ucWJks7a4y2akqKeeYr2qv8KeqmarlaXBprnBnqlmamBnfm65xJqloqaXZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
