Furthermore, he was an American by nationality. Likewise, he came from White ethnicity. And, his age at the time of his death was 44 years old.</li><li>More on his bio, he was born to his parents in Pennsylvania, USA. Moreover, his father’s name was Daniel Thomas Brodrick II. Similarly, his mom’s name was Yolande Wescott Gordon Broderick.</li><li>He seems to be the only child of his parents. Besides, he had a happy home while growing up and happy childhood.&nbsp;</li><li>Going back to the topic at hand, Dan was murdered by his first wife, Betty Broderick. After seven months of his new marriage, he was shot by a Smith & Wesson revolver by his first wife.</li><li>Taking a trip down the memory lane, he tied the knot with Betty back in 1969. However, years after their marriage, Mr. Broderick started having an affair.&nbsp;</li><li>And like any soap opera, it was his personal assistant and future wife, Linda Kolkena. Soon the situation at home turned sour and Dan and Betty got a divorce in 1989.&nbsp;</li><li>What’s more, after a few months of divorce, he exchanged his vows with Linda. But, his fantasy life ended in a grim note. On November 5th of 1989, his ex-wife went to his new home around 5 am.</li><li>Finally, his life came to an end from the hands of the woman he once called his partner. The report on the murder stated that the incident occurred at 5:30 in the morning.</li><li>And now, three decades later, his story is adapted in Netflix’s Dirty John’s season two. Will the creators keep the story faithful to real-life tragedy? Or will they spice things up a bit? All we can do now is wait and watch.</li><li>Lastly, at the time of his death, Daniel held an approximated net worth of $1 million. What’s more, he even bought his ex-wife $650 thousand La Jolla beach-front house after their divorce and paid $16 thousand monthly alimony.&nbsp;</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYlsFutMCpp56mlZl6tbuMnZinoZWheqO%2Bzp2cq6GToHqjsdOtsGaaoqSxpr7InKKsZZWteqnB0puYp5xdnsBusMirq7JlmqS1r3nSraClpF2WuarCxGarqJyRrnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
