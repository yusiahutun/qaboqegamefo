It offers a complete solution of the end-to-end processes in HR, which provides ease of leave, attendance, payroll, and claim management.&nbsp;</p><p>It is one of the few global ventures which offers almost all web/mobile-based modules from Hire to Retire Solutions with a state-of-the-art tech supporting those applications. ZingHR’s core focus is on OUTCOMATION™️, which aims at achieving Tangible and Measurable Business Outcomes Like Top Line, EBIDTA, People Efficiency, People Productivity. Some of the unassuming features like Leave and Attendance, Survey, Digital Onboarding, Payroll Software, Performance Management System, and many more.</p><p>Recently <a href=# rel=noopener>ZingHR </a>has introduced ZingNEO, a newly-launched vertical that aims to tap startups, SMBs, and micro-enterprises with focused HR tech solutions like AI in Chatbots, Robotic Interviews, Machine Learning, Surveys, QR Code Attendance, performance management software, Career and Succession Planning, ZingID and many more to achieve OUTCOMATION for these businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>In a talk Ravi Kikan, Director- Marketing at ZingNEO, let’s discover their journey since inception and his views on the current industry scenario</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What are the initial challenges you faced in the early days of the company?</h3><p>In any growing sector, challenges come in different forms regardless of whether you are a large enterprise or a small company. Being an HR Tech company our primary focus was to identify and overcome key HR challenges and build a solution that gives a holistic approach and curate a workplace culture that will ultimately impact how your business competes for talent, both now and in the future.</p><p>ZingNEO helps in fast-tracking business outcomes with the power of cutting-edge technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning that effortlessly facilitate crucial business and HR-related functions at the same time enabling remote and hybrid working culture. ZingNEO a subsidiary of ZingHR, is geared towards helping Startups and SMBs to enjoy high-end features of HR software at a budget-friendly cost.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What are the products/services the company focuses on? How are your services different from those in the market?</h3><p>We started with the vision to build software that enables top-level functionaries or HR professionals to have control of their work lives. Hence, we came up with ZingNEO- a Microlevel Human Resource Management System that empowers enterprises by accelerating engagement, productivity, talent acquisition & org-alignment.</p><p>Our HR software provides an integrated platform, which is one of a kind, in terms of assisting companies and large organizations in aligning business strategy with key decision-makers. ZingNEO <a href=#>HCM platform</a> can connect every interaction throughout the employee lifecycle. Although ZingHR and ZingNEO have a different target segment both of them offer 20+ critical HR modules along with features like Chat Bots, Customer References, Support, Governance, Risk, Compliance (GRC), and so on.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Being a successful HR Tech solution provider how do you increase the quality and speed of the hiring process for clients?</h3><p>The pandemic underscores the urgency for a more dynamic talent and having a robust hiring model in the first place. Often in the case of startups and small businesses, not having a clearly defined hiring plan exceeds the budget and timeline. Recruiting is a risk-based challenge, not just for startups, but also for established businesses because you cannot predict if an individual will be an asset to your company or not, which is why analytics takes an upper hand here.</p><p>ZingNEO provides ease of control for all recruitment functions with an intuitive online dashboard and quicker sourcing, hiring, and interviewing process powered by machine learning, natural language processing, and intelligent personality insights.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What do you think are the responsibilities of HR Tech solutions providers?</h3><p>The primary responsibilities of HR Tech solutions providers are to make the software usableness smooth by enhancing UI&UX, increase adaptability by integrating self-service (ESS) and manager self-service (MSS) tools, along with providing reskilling strategies for workers—including training HR professionals. Both our products ZingHR and ZingNEO are equipped with these features.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Why it is said that HR Tech solution providers play a vital role in every business landscape?</h3><p>With increasing, globalization and expansion come increasing diversity, a decentralized workforce as well as a need for efficient management. And an able HR armed with viable HR Tech solutions is the key to bringing about seamless integration across various business verticals and providing better business intelligence and decision-making analytics for companies to grow in the most efficient manner possible. Thus, for the entirety of the business landscape, HR Tech plays a vital role in shaping business processes and encouraging the workforce to achieve the organization’s goals collaboratively.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>According to you how has the HR solutions sector changed with rising technology?</h3><p>Emerging HR technologies are reshaping the way organizations used to work some years back. Among the host of disruptive technologies, AI and machine learning are opening the door to a whole new world of possibility in the space of HR. It enables recruiters in smart hiring and often outperforms humans at making hiring decisions in certain areas, such as evaluation based on hard skills, soft-skill, and cultural fit in any organization. HR solution like ZingNEO also takes care of the compliance part.&nbsp;</p><p>Keeping up with the evolving laws and regulation has often been a major challenge for HR teams and often require vast amounts of paperwork and information but an HRMS makes this a hassle-free process.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How do you decide to take the company a step further?</h3><p>ZingHR is quite a prominent name in the HR Tech industry, as being a disruptor brand, entering new markets. However, ZingNEO being its subsidiary we are expecting to accelerate its adaptability by adding more features into it and offer startups and SMBs something strikingly different that would help them to stand out.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Share your words for the business struggling to accelerate their growth in pandemic scenarios.</h3><p>The pandemic has toppled nearly every aspect of life, and businesses especially SMBs and Startups are being hit hardest across countries and sectors. The right policies, planning, and tech solutions are imperative to give them the support they need to survive and continue to contribute to the global economy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZMequsannKhlopbDqnnKoqKapl2ZtrOxwq2mq2Wdlr%2BssdOipaA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
