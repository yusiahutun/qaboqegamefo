The boy's mother, LaTonya Eason, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>also told reporters</strong></a>, "I'm very pleased that they did dismiss what was going on with my baby."</p><p>TooFab has reached out to Harlow and the Civil Process office for Tate County for comment.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:79a765df-1463-4724-9097-992a5b7b56ce data-container-ref=toofab:article:25889487-8101-4b7c-9afa-66cc651f557c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e5/5by4/2023/09/11/e5cb248d3ebc4e888cfca8e15fb1211d_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Facebook</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">10-Year-Old Arrested for Peeing In Parking Lot Sentenced, Mom Says It's Not 'Right' or 'Fair'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Eason was arrested by the Senatobia Police Department back in August, after the child reportedly decided to relieve himself near her car while she made a quick stop into a lawyer's office.</p><p>During a court hearing back in December, the boy was given three months probation and assigned a two-page book report about Kobe Bryant, the family's attorney Carlos Moore told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>CNN</strong></a>. Under the terms of the sentence, he would have been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>required</strong></a> to check in with a probation officer once a month for three months; his mom refused to sign the probation document at the time.</p><p>During a press conference back in September, Moore said that the child needed to use the bathroom while waiting for his mother. He saw a sign saying there were no public restrooms, however, and "had a decision to make."</p><p>"Do I let my bladder stay full and potentially cause bladder problems or do I relieve myself discreetly on private property?" said the family's attorney. "He did what so many young boys have done in this city time and time again, he got near his mother's car with his back facing the public road and he relieved himself."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:27128f80-54ed-4741-89b0-cecbf1f658b9 data-container-ref=toofab:article:25889487-8101-4b7c-9afa-66cc651f557c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e5/5by4/2023/09/11/e5cb248d3ebc4e888cfca8e15fb1211d_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Facebook</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Mom of 10-Year-Old Arrested for Peeing In Parking Lot Demands Officer Be Named, Fired</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Though Moore said the child was "thinking as a reasonable 10-year-old" when he decided to relieve himself, an officer driving by stopped and went into the lawyer's office to alert the boy's mother.</p><p>"I said, 'You know better, don't let it happen again,'" Eason recalled telling her son after coming out with the officer. "The officer said, 'You handled that like a mom, just make sure he don't do it again, he can get back in the car.'"</p><p>But then four other officers from the department showed up, said Eason, claiming they then instructed Quantavious to "put his hands behind his back" before putting him into a patrol car and taking him downtown to the station. "My baby was crying," said Eason, who also snapped a photo of the boy in the backseat.</p><p>After being taken to the station, Eason claims authorities then "put this boy in a cage for 45-minutes to an hour" while she spoke with officers about an unrelated matter. The boy was later charged in Youth Court with Child in Need of Supervision. Per Moore, the incident happened on private property and "nobody who owns that property has complained to law enforcement" about the boy's actions.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:0353075d-9d7c-494e-a9a8-3c4ea404b30d data-container-ref=toofab:article:25889487-8101-4b7c-9afa-66cc651f557c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/37/5by4/2024/01/31/37c606ec79114052beb30569c8691bc9_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Facebook / Julie Voshell Hartman</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Woman Who Dropped Pants, Flashed Plane During Frontier Flight Meltdown Hit with Federal Charges</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>After the incident went viral thanks to Eason's photo of her son, the police department released two statements on what happened. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>In the first</strong></a>, they said that while "the child was not handcuffed," they admitted "it was an error in judgment for us to transport the child to the police station" since authorities were able to locate a parent at the scene.</p><p>"Mistakes like this are a reminder in this profession as to the continual need for training and refreshers on the various topics that we encounter each day," they added.</p><p>About a week later, Chief of Police Richard Chandler <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>released a second statement</strong></a> saying, "The officer's decisions violated our written policy and went against our prior training on how to deal with these situations."</p><p>"One of the officers involved is no longer employed, and the others will be disciplined," they added. "We will also have mandatory Juvenile training department-wide, just as we do every year."</p><p>"You don't put my child in a cage," Eason said at the time. "Would you have put a white child in a cage? If it had been a white child, you know what, he probably wouldnâ€™t have even stopped."</p><p>Moore previously told NBC he's planning to fire a federal lawsuit against the city of Senatobia and the arresting officer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2tmaW5fn8Kls8RmqZ6ulafApr%2BMq6yloZ6ceqe70WZoaWWpmq6zec6lm2aZoqeytMDEnWSfp6JiwrO1zZqroqaXYravec%2BumaWhk2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
