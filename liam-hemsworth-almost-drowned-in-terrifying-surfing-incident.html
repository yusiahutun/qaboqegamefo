That’s part of the fun of it,” the <a href=#>celebrity</a> said. “The adrenaline you get from surfing big waves. I’ve seen a shark before. You get the worst wipeouts when you’re not expecting it.</p><p>“When I was a kid, one time I got my leg rope wrapped around my whole body like a ball, underwater. Couldn’t get up. I was in waist-deep water, but I almost drowned. You know, I’ve had a few times.”</p><p>The leg ropes on surfboards are used to keep them nearby, in case a surfer is swept off his board. One end has a strap to go around the ankle, while the other tethers to the surfer board.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Glen Powell ‘almost died’ filming racy scene with co-star – ‘But it was worth it’</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-liam-still-surfs-despite-the-danger>Liam still surfs despite the danger</h2><p>Luckily, despite the terrifying surfing incident and others like it, Liam Hemsworth still gets on his surfboard in the sea. He is often photographed shirtless and on the beach letting off some steam.</p><p>In August last year, he was spotted at the beach and amongst the waves with his older brother Chris. The two brothers were celebrating Chris’ birthday as he turned 40.</p><p>It seems, whatever the weather, he will be up for getting wet. The <a href=#>movie</a> star posted a picture of himself surrounded by snow in a wetsuit while on a surfboard and in the water. At the time, he was filming for the TV show Limitless with Chris Hemsworth.</p><p>The docu-series followed his older brother “on a mission to live better for longer” where he “takes on six epic challenges to test mind and body to the max.”</p><p>On his <a href=#>Instagram</a>, he wrote: “A couple icy cold snaps from @craigparryphotography during the shooting of #limitlesswithchrishemsworth.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>The Walking Dead star was convinced he was ‘going to die’ after accident on set</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2aAcLjImqRmoJWiwLi70a2fZpmcory0wIydqaivnpqxbrXNZqueqqKes7q1zaBkrK2im7avs4yipZyhlJq7tXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
