(Some may even go as far as to call this gift “hidden,” as it’s mostly invisible from the Earth for a few hours.) This lovely present is, of course, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the new moon</a>, and it happens every 28 to 30 days.</p><p>In astrological terms, the new moon is one of the moon’s many phases—specifically, the one where the moon and sun align. The sun shines behind the moon, blocking us from its view. The new moon marks the beginning of a new lunar cycle and often brings with it an array of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">new beginnings</a>. This leaves new moons feeling like a particularly ideal time for&nbsp;self-reflection, course correction and goal-setting.</p><p>Interestingly enough, most people are unconsciously aligned with this energy, tending to create new habits, start new projects and initiate life changes around the same time as the new moon. That’s cool. What’s even cooler is that consciously embracing the new moon’s fresh energy can allow you to propel those transitions even further.</p><p>Ahead, seven things to try (and four things to not&nbsp;try) during <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the new moon</a>. Consider this a field guide to new moons in all their energetic glory—a resource you can revisit every 28 to 30 days from here on out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>1. Set a Worthwhile Intention</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1358840066-2.jpg><p>Every month, the moon delivers us an extra boost of intention-setting energy. Why not hone it by focusing on one or two intentions you’re particularly passionate about?</p><p>Take some time to craft intentions that are clear, concise and as specific as you can make them. Think: “Obtain a new job that brings me fulfillment, with a higher salary than I currently have.” Or: “Pass the bar exam on my next try.” These intentions are clear and specific. Not only will they inform the universe of your aspirations, but they’ll also keep you focused on what it is you’re really after.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>2. Light a Candle</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1414867063.jpg><p>Or bring some light into your life in some other way.&nbsp;Lighting a candle on the darkest night of the month signifies our desire to bring just a little more light into our lives. Ask the universe to shine light on you during this new moon and all the ones that follow it.</p><p>You can also take this ritual a step further by charging your candle with an intention you wish to manifest during this moon cycle. Simply hold the candle, summon feelings of gratitude and love, and ask the universe for what it is you want. Light the candle, and allow it to burn out on its own.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>3. Begin Something New</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1300190856.jpg><p>The new moon is the most fertile day of the lunar cycle each month. If there was a perfect time for initiating anything new, it would certainly be the new moon! Start a new class. Apply for that job. Ask that person on a date.&nbsp;Start anything and everything you feel passionate about. Now is the perfect moment to begin anew.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>4. Go on a First Date</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-899705634.jpg><p>Speaking of starting something new—a first date is a&nbsp;wonderful activity for a new moon. The universe is brimming with energy and possibility making the perfect time to plant the seeds for a new relationship. Whether you’re getting to know a new friend or a new lover, your connection is bound to blossom if it begins around a new moon.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4><h2>5. Make a List</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-174457185.jpg><p>Remember those intentions we talked about earlier? Well, if you want to super-magnify them, make a whole list of all the details you’d like the universe to consider when bringing you your heart’s desire.</p><p>Say your intention was to find a new job. Where will your office be? What will your hours be like? What will your boss be like? What kinds of projects will you work on? The same goes for love. What type of relationship do you want? What do you do with your partner for fun?</p><p>Make it as detailed as you can. The idea is to create an image in your mind of what this new situation will look like when you get there, so you can stay focused on what’s truly meaningful to you.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>6. Create a Sacred Space</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GettyImages-1138309237.jpg><p>The new moon is the optimal time for setting a sacred space in your home to make your own magic. Cleanse the energy of the place where you’ll be meditation, manifesting and self-reflecting. Get the junk of the world out—and keep it out.</p><p>In time, when you enter that space, your body and mind will know it’s time to make magic. Make sure after you’ve set it up, you keep it clean and tidy to avoid bad vibes.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6><h2>7. Design Your Own Ritual</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1396691220.jpg><p>If you’re thinking of salt circles and witches over a cauldron, just remember that although these rituals certainly exist, that’s not necessarily what we’re talking about here. Making your own ritual is simply a matter of creating a set of practices you commit to doing during every new moon. It could be as simple as meditating, taking a yoga class, or writing a list. Or, it can be as elaborate as creating a space, making a crystal grid, taking a cleanse bath or smudging your entire apartment.</p><p>Whatever it is, make sure it incorporates taking a moment to reflect and plant a few seeds of intention. Taking periodic pauses can help you avoid venturing too far down a path that’s not aligned with your heart.&nbsp;Use the new moon as a reminder to stop, access and maneuver to your dreams.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>1. Quitting Something You Care About</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1193064515.jpg></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>2. Avoiding New People</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1086037542.jpg><p>New moons are notorious for bringing people into our lives. Often these newcomers bring us lessons our souls crave. Don’t miss out on these. When you encounter someone different or outside your usual type during a new moon, be open and curious. Try to learn about them. You never know what joys or ideas they may bring.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>3. Declining Unexpected Opportunities</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1417457471.jpg><p>Speaking of meeting new folks, a new moon is a great time to try something different and start the process of a new venture. Since a new moon is great for meeting new people and taking on new opportunities, consider saying yes to the invitations that speak to you. However, that doesn’t mean ignoring red flags, because any opportunity you start now—and I mean any—is bound to grow and progress in a way that impacts your life down the line.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>4. Spending Time With Energy Suckers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1403986369.jpg><p>This is a no-no in general, but it can’t always be avoided.&nbsp;Since new moon energy is so incredibly special, shun any energy-drainers and do so unabashedly. You want to harness all the positive and creative energy flowing around you; none of it should be sacrificed. Simply said, don’t let others kill your vibe.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfo7K4ecyopqdlop7Btq3LrGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
