Though Smith's death was initially deemed a hit and run, the case was reopened in June 2021, based on information learned while investigating the murders of Buster's mother Margaret "Maggie" Murdaugh and younger brother Paul. However, nobody in the Murdaugh family was ever officially named as a suspect.</p><p>When asked about both rumors <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>in a preview clip of the doc</strong></a>, Murdaugh called them "baseless."</p><p>"I unequivocally deny anything that you just read off of that piece of paper. I did not have any personal, intimate relations with Stephen and that cannot be proven because it is baseless," he said. "I never had anything to do with his murder, I never had anything to do with him on a physical level of any regard."</p><p>When MacCallum then asked where he was the night Smith was killed, Murdaugh said he was at the family's Edisto Beach house. He added that he was with his mom and brother, who, of course, can't vouch for his alibi since they were killed in June 2021.</p><p>Buster's father, Alex, is currently serving two life sentences for their murders.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:0034019d-78d5-4fd8-aa17-597ea5f5bd47 data-container-ref=toofab:article:2849b816-ac23-421d-b722-1911996e8455 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/27/5by4/2023/03/20/270148c0971d4173a478a278a66d520b_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">GoFundMe / Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Buster Murdaugh Denies 'Vicious Rumors' Connecting Him to Stephen Smith Death</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I don't want to be rude here, but have you ever been accused of murdering somebody?" asked Buster, after he was asked how it feels to be the subject of such allegations. "Well, let me tell you, this is very, very, very, very, very ... it's a terrible thing to place on somebody with absolutely no fact. I mean, it has harmed my reputation. I mean, people perceive me as a murderer."</p><p>During the same interview, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Buster also defended his father</strong></a>, who he insists is innocent.</p><p>"I do not think that he could be affiliated with endangering my mother and brother. We have been here for a while now and that's been my stance," he told McCallum, adding that he believes the real killer is still out there and "absolutely" worries about his own safety.</p><p>"I think I set myself up to be safe but yes, when I go to bed at night I have a fear that there is somebody that is still out there," he added.</p><p>The 3-part documentary hits Fox Nation this Thursday.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:9af48f9d-e2f5-43f0-9a87-f88fbb4d2dec data-container-ref=toofab:article:2849b816-ac23-421d-b722-1911996e8455 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/0e/5by4/2023/08/29/0e71ce90264649e78dc30cfb1c0e14df_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty/File Photo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Teen Girl, 16, Killed in Fight Over McDonald's Sweet and Sour Sauce: Police</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Fma3Ffl8K0wMSrZKatopmutrPHZpuerJGeubR51qGcq51dnbJuw8CsZKehl53Bbr%2FTnqehnZ5iwK6106FkpKGcobKlew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
