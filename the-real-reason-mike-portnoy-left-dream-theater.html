So, what are the real reasons behind Mike Portnoy leaving Dream Theater?
He Didn’t Want to be a Drummer With One Band All His Life Ever since founding the band in 1985 as a 20-year old, Mike had always played with Dream Theater, but it was starting to take a toll on him."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He felt like he would be stuck with the other four band members all his life—and that thought scared him.&nbsp;</p><p>He saw the idea of leaving the group as a chance to spread his&nbsp;wings&nbsp;and explore&nbsp;life&nbsp;outside&nbsp;Dream Theater.&nbsp;And true to that, after leaving the band, he has gone on to do over 40&nbsp;albums&nbsp;with different bands. Most of these bands have different&nbsp;styles&nbsp;ranging from<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">&nbsp;prog</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;metal&nbsp;and rock, and according to him, this is a testament that he is a diverse&nbsp;artist&nbsp;and a vast&nbsp;music&nbsp;lover.&nbsp;</p><p>Mike is also thankful to all the&nbsp;fans&nbsp;who have followed his&nbsp;musical passions&nbsp;ever since he left DT. He says that he receives so much love from his fans through attending his shows, supporting him online, and buying his records—and this reassures him that he made the right decision.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>He was Burnt Out</h2><p>Overseeing a&nbsp;band&nbsp;rise from its&nbsp;formation&nbsp;to the level of&nbsp;Dream Theater&nbsp;with many hit&nbsp;records&nbsp;under its name is not easy. And working on something consistently for 25 years is bound to come with its fair share of exhaustion. This is precisely what happened to Portnoy—he was tired!</p><p>What many&nbsp;people&nbsp;don’t know is that&nbsp;Portnoy&nbsp;was not just a drummer. He would oversee several other things like production, the melodies, the lyrics, the websites, the&nbsp;fan clubs, and the band’s merchandise. Doing all these things was&nbsp;fun&nbsp;at first, but with time, it became exhausting.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>With&nbsp;Dream Theater&nbsp;being at its height of popularity with multiple shows and upcoming albums,&nbsp;Portnoy&nbsp;had no&nbsp;time&nbsp;to recharge his batteries, and the weight of responsibility was bound to grow even more. But, he could not take it anymore, and so he called it quits.&nbsp;</p><p>Upon leaving the band,&nbsp;Portnoy&nbsp;has always insisted that he has&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">no regrets</a>&nbsp;over what he did (he even has a&nbsp;tattoo&nbsp;that says ‘No Regrets’). He adds that if he had continued with the band, he would have grown resentful, which would have had a severe effect on his productivity.&nbsp;</p><p>To understand how much responsibility the bearded&nbsp;drummer&nbsp;was entrusted with and his immense work ethic, the other&nbsp;band&nbsp;members, had to delegate some of the work that he did to external&nbsp;parties&nbsp;and share some of it amongst themselves.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>He Wanted to Save his&nbsp;Relationship&nbsp;With Other&nbsp;Band&nbsp;Members</h2><p>It is believed that by the&nbsp;time&nbsp;Portnoy&nbsp;left DT,&nbsp;tensions&nbsp;were high between the&nbsp;band&nbsp;members to the point that one unnamed member had ceased interacting with the others, even during tours.&nbsp;</p><p>Prior to&nbsp;recording&nbsp;their album,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A Dramatic Turn of Events</a>,&nbsp;Portnoy&nbsp;expressed his dissatisfaction with the state of&nbsp;affairs&nbsp;and proposed a 5-year&nbsp;hiatus&nbsp;for the&nbsp;band&nbsp;to allow everyone to recharge. This suggestion was received with&nbsp;displeasure&nbsp;by the other group members as they didn’t see the need to take a break. They also felt Portnoy was unreasonable as he had just been on tour with another band,&nbsp;Avenged Sevenfold,&nbsp;to fill in for their deceased drummer.&nbsp;</p><p>With Portnoy’s suggestion being dismissed by the other&nbsp;band&nbsp;members, he felt that he could not continue with the group. If he had stayed, he knew that the&nbsp;relationship&nbsp;between them would only go downhill from there. And so, he left to save the relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>Portnoy’s&nbsp;decision&nbsp;to leave the group was justified as he maintained a good&nbsp;relationship&nbsp;with the&nbsp;band&nbsp;members after leaving.&nbsp;John Petrucci, DT’s guitarist, appeared on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rock Talk With Mitch Lafon</a>&nbsp;on 18th August 2020 and admitted that since they had been together in the band for 25 years, they were like brothers and their families grew up together. Even after Portney left DT, they still maintained close contact—even hanging out and going on holidays together. And to make matters even better, Portnoy would be playing in Petrucci’s&nbsp;upcoming solo album&nbsp;named ‘Terminal Velocity.’</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Takeaway</h2><p>When&nbsp;Portnoy&nbsp;left DT, the&nbsp;news&nbsp;generated a lot of fuss in the media. Every&nbsp;post&nbsp;he wrote on social media was turned into a huge clickbait headline—and this came with its fair share of&nbsp;internet&nbsp;trolls. The saddest thing is that many&nbsp;people&nbsp;did not care to understand why Portnoy had decided to leave a&nbsp;band&nbsp;that he sacrificially built from scratch. Upon understanding the&nbsp;reasons&nbsp;now, it is clear that he made the right decision, both at a personal level and career-wise.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjOrKqynpmasW%2BvzqZmraCVYr%2BmrctmqZ6Zo6S7brnIpJxmqJ%2Bnwa%2B72Gajnp6kYrGzscCmZK2glZbBpr6O</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
