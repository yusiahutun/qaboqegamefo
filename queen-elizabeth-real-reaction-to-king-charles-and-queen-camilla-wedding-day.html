She certainly was at the blessing at St George’s Chapel," he began in an interview with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Guides For Bride</a>, before reiterating that she ensured her son knew he had her blessing.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">DISCOVER:</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Previously unseen photos of the late Queen and King Charles displayed at Buckingham Palace" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/89505cf729f3-gettyimages-841871362.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Previously unseen photos of the late Queen and King Charles displayed at Buckingham Palace" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Previously unseen photos of the late Queen and King Charles displayed at Buckingham Palace</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="King Charles and Queen Camilla's most loved-up moments in 14 sweet photos" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/5ef80d532517-charles-camilla-pda.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="King Charles and Queen Camilla's most loved-up moments in 14 sweet photos" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>King Charles and Queen Camilla's most loved-up moments in 14 sweet photos</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Princess Kate's wedding cake maker recalls surprising 'informal' request" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/7954dc6d408c-gettyimages-113265763.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Princess Kate's wedding cake maker recalls surprising 'informal' request" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Princess Kate's wedding cake maker recalls surprising 'informal' request</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Royal wedding plus ones!

There was talk about whether she would attend the service but her appearance at the reception was a joyful one. Her attendance and speech would have been seen as an olive branch to Charles and Camilla. Her blessing of the marriage. The royals don’t do things lightly and she would have not attended if she hadn’t been happy to," he said.</p><p id=eoqu1f8CNsd data-wc=37>While photos show the groom's mother smiling with Charles and Camilla, the details of their drinks reception at St George’s Hall remained largely private.

The Queen was amazing at the wedding, she gave a very funny speech, she was really happy as was Prince Philip. I can’t remember her exact words but she was funny. She compared their relationship to a Grand National horse race. She was a great comedian and had a way with words," he said.</p><p id=eDAHWYwNIUc data-wc=28>The butler painted a picture of a surprisingly normal wedding, complete with special moments between the groom and his mother and "a real party atmosphere" for the guests.</p><figure class="videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff -recommended-video"><span class=videoPlayerStyleHeader_v1l4r7u3>Recommended video</span><span class=videoPlayerStyleTitle_v1pm0z4u>You may also like</span>WATCH: King Charles and Queen Camilla's intimate wedding day in 60 seconds</figure><p id=eDyo-ulvcVI data-wc=51>“Charles was grinning ear to ear the whole day. He was so happy," said Grant, adding: "One of my fondest memories is the Queen gathering outside with friends and family to wave the newlyweds off in the car. She was waving and smiling excitedly.
