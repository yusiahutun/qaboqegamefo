The Tifton, Ga. native got started in music a little later in life, taking up guitar while attending college, and got his first live experience during that time. After college he moved to Hawaii, but ended up in Nashville in 2004, where he connected with songwriter and producer Brett James, who helped him get a publishing deal. He signed with MCA Nashville as an artist and released his debut single, "Mary Was the Marrying Kind," in 2011, reaching No. 45. His second single, "Somethin' 'Bout a Truck," scored Moore his first No. 1 hit, and his debut album, 'Up All Night,' was released in April of 2012. "Beer Money" and "Hey Pretty Girl" followed, both reaching the Top 5 and helping 'Up All Night' to become 2012's best-selling debut by a male country artist. Moore toured extensively to promote the album, developing a reputation as one of the most exciting live performers in country music with his rock-edged shows. He released his sophomore album, 'Wild Ones,' in August of 2015. The album has spawned three singles in "Young Love," "Dirt Road" and "I'm to Blame,"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmrZmXqHystc9mpKinopp8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
