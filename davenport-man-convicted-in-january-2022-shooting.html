Evidence at trial showed that an altercation started inside the Thunderguard Club,<br>then located at 1314 Washington Street, spilled out onto Washington Street, and resulted in<br>numerous shots being fired.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/01/Mug-Shot-Leonard-Fisher.jpg><p>When officers arrived on scene, they located two separate sets of shell casings, and a firearm next to a pool of blood. Fisher’s DNA matched the pool of blood next to the gun, and he was identified as being one of the shooters via surveillance video, the release said.</p><p>The other shooter, Timothy Eugene Angel, 39, of Clinton, was federally charged with being a<br>felon in possession of ammunition, as the gun he used was never recovered. Angel pled guilty and is set for sentencing in federal court on Jan. 24, 2023. Fisher’s sentencing date has not yet been set.</p><p>Both men face up to 10 years in federal prison. There is no parole in the federal court system.</p><p>U.S. Attorney Richard D. Westphal of the Southern District of Iowa made the announcement.
