One of the major challenges she says she faces is the stereotyping and labelling she gets as a Chinese designer in the US.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Why do we have to be an American brand or a Chinese brand?” she asks. “My team is from all over the world. Being Chinese is tough because it isn’t loved politically by anyone.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If you’re Japanese, everyone loves Japan. If you’re Chinese, there’s so much negativity against us.

The collection, inspired by European craftsmanship and Breton’s past six seasons in Europe, featured dapper outfits for men and women, with tailoring of the sort seen on <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">London’s Savile Row</span></a> and lush ball gowns made in France.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The collection also tied into Breton’s Asian roots – the designer grew up in Taiwan and is a goodwill ambassador for the Taiwan Tourism Bureau – and marked a continuation of his work championing the Chinese island territory.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When you grow up [in Taiwan], you grow up around nature. You grow up believing in this idea that nature and the sea, everything flows,” said Breton, who was a dancer for years and who works to create ease and comfort in his tailored pieces.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/02/27/0a0f3b19-38fd-49e6-8ee7-cb1c7e6a0360_2900e250.jpg>NYFW also saw interest in Japanese designer Hanako Maeda’s label Adeam, which showed a gender-neutral collection from 2021. Actresses Natasha Lyonne and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Lana Condor</span></a> and stylist Cristina Ehrlich were among those who showed up to see Maeda’s risqué pieces with lace and ruffled shoulders.Maeda was born in Japan but spent some of her childhood in New York. Growing up in the early ’00s, she listened to pop-punk bands like Green Day and Blink-182, and she enjoyed the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">punk/grunge</span></a> subculture’s anti-fashion look.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She can recall dragging her dad around Harajuku in Tokyo in search of X-Girl, a streetwear brand founded by Kim Gordon of alternative rock band Sonic Youth.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While Maeda’s new collection, “Ichi”, is inspired by grunge’s androgynous aesthetic and her own American upbringing, her designs reference traditional Japanese attire – including garments like the kimono.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/02/27/29bb1a76-b748-48a1-b5da-a38e16a21783_1346010f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Also on show at NYFW was the Asia Fashion Collection – an incubation project from Vantan and Parco Co. Ltd featuring looks from up-and-coming designers from the continent.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This year, the project featured looks from five labels: désir by Jun Nakamura, Saika by Saika Sekita and Asato by Asato Kitamura, all from Japan; Taiwanese label Chiahung Su by Su Chia-hung; and South Korean label FromWhere by Lee Young-eun.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A common theme among the designers was oversized clothing, from large comfortable skirts to embellished jumpers and full-length hooded coats.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/02/27/37b837ae-f9b9-443b-8d60-1733f1a7218b_c353f864.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There were more references to Asian cultures throughout NYFW – the Japanese brand Dokka Vivid, for example, had models carry lanterns as a nod to their heritage.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Private Policy, a New York-based genderless brand co-founded by Chinese designers Haoran Li and Siying Qu, who hail from Qingdao and Xining in China respectively, showed a collection called “We are all animals”.</p>The duo, whose designs have been worn by model <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Hailey Bieber</span></a> and influencers Bret Rock and Kendall Jenner, opened their runway show with a performance inspired by Japanese folk tale The Fox’s Wedding, with models donning foxlike masks and wearing shirts and matching trousers in buttery hues.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/02/27/4e0214d5-f205-47f9-b9dc-6a7bd66126ef_f079018b.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">South Korean designers were highlighted during the Concept Korea show, with three brands from Seoul showing their autumn/winter collections: Besfxxk, which gives classic garments a more experimental edge; Cahiers, with its clever play on the school uniform; and Ulkin, a brand that takes inspiration from industrial uniforms.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Besfxxk’s collection was inspired by items like the trench coat and the smoking jacket, says Kim Bona, who founded the brand with her husband, Lim Jae-hyuk.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The brand, worn by artists like R&B singer Monica and K-pop group Girls Generation, incorporates design elements from Asian clothing – think plaid school uniforms, woven fabrics, collared shirts and frilly accents.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kim says Asian designers rarely get the credit they deserve. “It takes a certain level of market understanding … and a strong dedication to brand distribution in different markets [to do well].”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/02/27/7ae02432-b926-494d-b038-0be465f22e3c_6ab366ca.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cahiers’ uniform-like looks tap into the nostalgia that surrounds teenage culture while evoking themes of “regulation, control and uniformity”, says designer Kim Ayoung. The brand, worn by the likes of K-pop artists IU and Bae Suzy, reflects a Korean sensibility through its silhouettes and colour palette.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For Ulkin designer Lee Sung-dong, the brand’s new, industrial-inspired collection is all about safety. “We often face many risks and threats, but there are times when we don’t even realise that we are in danger,” says Dong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The upcycled collection, which mimics details and silhouettes from workwear and construction uniforms, centre around these blind spots. The hibiscus flower, the national flower of South Korea, features in many of the pieces.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We believe using elements that represent the nation and culture empowers brand identity and [heritage],” says Lee.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Being successful in each market is about competitiveness and opportunity, which comes from a strong business model and strategy,” he says. “NYFW is a global show, so it’s a great opportunity to reach out and expand.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiv8eipqdlkpqutsDYaJirrJmYuaZ7kmtoam5naXyjscinnmabmJ67pr%2FEZquorZedeq%2Bx1mawqKqbYrOiv8eipqdlp5qyrL%2BMmqqimZ5isaa%2FyKClnqqjYsC1sdGepq2xoJrAbq3NnWSsrJGpsq6xza2qZqyYmraz</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
