Homegirl is putting Kansas City on the map! Maybe now New Yorkers will stop sticking their nose up, saying things like, Kansas City? Where is that, somewhere in the middle? Newsflash to them: life outside of the coasts does exist. I digress.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/travis-kelce-kiss-marry-kill-taylor-swift.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reba-mcentire-taylor-swift.jpg><p>So, if #Traylor’s going steady,&nbsp;where might fans spot them next, and more importantly, where should they actually go? Allow moi to be your tour guide for Kansas City’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>best date night spots</a> and <a href=# id=auto-tag_date-night data-tag=date-night>date night</a> ideas, a.k.a. where I think Taylor and Travis might eat, sip, and play.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=where-to-eat-in-kansas-city>Where to Eat in Kansas City</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=andy-s-frozen-custard><a href=# rel=nofollow>Andy’s Frozen Custard</a></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Who doesn’t love a sweet treat? Travis might give Taylor a taste test of the one he created for Andy’s Frozen Custard back in 2018, the 87 Concrete. (Taylor should know the number 87 all too well, given she now has a <a href=# rel=nofollow>friendship bracelet </a>with it.) It’s a blend of Oreos, cookie dough, melted chocolate chips, and crème caramel. Plus, 87 cents of every concrete sold was previously donated to <a href=# rel=nofollow>87 & Running</a>, Travis’ mentorship foundation for underserved youth.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=q39><a rel=nofollow href=#>Q39</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/4-1.png><p>Thanks to his personal chef, we know Travis is a simple Midwest <a href=#>dude who loves steak, chops, and chicken</a>—but most importantly, filets. Perhaps he fancies Q39? Their private dining experience is far from reach of the paps. #Traylor can drool over their award-winning smoked meats and wood-fired grilled plates in peace.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=chef-j><a href=# rel=nofollow>Chef J</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Untitled-design-30.png><p>For a taste of some KC BBQ, Travis should introduce Taylor to Chef J’s BBQ. Not only is it ranked as the top spot for <a href=# rel=nofollow>best barbeque in Kansas City</a> by Kansas City Magazine, but it’s so good they’re serving ‘que at Chiefs games now! Catch ‘em at the kiosk in section 107 on the home sideline.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=chick-in-waffle><a rel=nofollow href=#>Chick-in-waffle</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1-1.png><p>We all know <a rel=nofollow href=#>Taylor Swift has heart eyes for chicken tenders</a>—and if Travis did his research, he’d know she told Vogue in her game of “<a rel=nofollow href=#>73 Questions</a>” they’re her fave too. Chick-in-waffle has the best chicken tenders in Kansas City with eight signature sauces to choose from. Don’t trust my word for it? Check out all the reviews on <a rel=nofollow href=#>Yelp</a>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=vivalore><a href=# rel=nofollow>Vivalore</a></h3><p>Known for its enchanting courtyard and delicate decor, Taylor might have her eyes set on booking a reservation at the elegant Vivalore. This whimsical, one-of-a-kind dining experience is bejeweled with a fine art gallery and charming antiques, so it looks<strong> </strong>like a scene ripped from one of Taylor’s music videos.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=where-to-drink-in-kansas-city>Where to Drink in Kansas City</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=power-light-district><a href=# rel=nofollow>Power & Light District</a></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Sporty Taylor isn’t new. Remember when she played tennis in “The Man” music video? You might spot the couple getting out of an Escalade (or, in my wildest dreams, the Kansas City streetcar) to catch a game at a local sports bar like <a href=# rel=nofollow>No Other Pub by Sporting KC</a> in KC’s Power & Light District.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=clinton-s-soda-fountain><a href=# rel=nofollow>Clinton’s Soda Fountain</a></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Taylor might not have been cheer captain, but her current relationship is giving homecoming-queen-meets-jock-and-hangs-at-the-town-soda-shop-after-school. For that reason, I could totally see them drinking a <a href=# rel=nofollow>Polly’s Pop</a> at Clinton’s Soda Fountain on the Independence Square for some old-school lovin’ vibes.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=prime-social><a rel=nofollow href=#>Prime Social</a></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Who doesn’t love a rooftop moment? Prime Social is a rooftop cocktail lounge on Kansas City’s historic Country Club Plaza with gorgeous panoramic views KC. Taylor and Travis could be found cozied up by a fire pit, planning their next KC outing over a glass of wine.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=sugar-kittens-cat-cafe-cattery><a rel=nofollow href=#>Sugar Kittens Cat Cafe & Cattery</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2.png><p>I wouldn’t put it past Taylor to fly Meredith Grey, Olivia Benson, and Benjamin Button out to Kansas City, but I understand if they’re not the best travelers. If Taylor needs a feline fix, only two cat cafes in the Kansas City metropolitan area can save her. Sugar Kittens Cat Cafe & Cattery is located in a nearby KC suburb, which might have fewer eyes from the public, but a second option is <a href=# rel=nofollow>Whiskers Cat Cafe & Coffeehouse</a> in downtown KC. Who knows, maybe she’ll adopt a fourth fur baby?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=where-to-play-in-kansas-city>Where to Play in Kansas City</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3.png><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=bar-k><a href=# rel=nofollow>Bar K</a></h3><p>As a proud dog dad to his goldendoogle Rambo and pomeranian-husky mix Chauncey, Travis knows Bar K quite well. This picture is the cutest! I’m calling it now: on a weekend when Taylor’s in town, Travis rents the whole place out, invites all his friends and their pets out, and surprises Taylor with a furry, fun hangout. Nothing’s impossible, so stroll down Berkley Parkway every once in a while.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=kansas-city-union-station><a href=# rel=nofollow>Kansas City Union Station</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Untitled-design-29.png><p>Host of the 2023 NFL draft and end spot for Super Bowl parades, Union Station should sound familiar to NFL fans. Travis might want to show Taylor his old stomping ground. Locals love showing out-of-towners the beautiful train station’s indoor planetarium and city theater. Private showing of The Eras Tour film for two?</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=the-majestic><a href=# rel=nofollow>The Majestic</a></h3><p>Jazz, anyone? The Majestic is a local steakhouse by day and jazz club by night, built inside the historic Fitzpatrick Saloon building. I don’t think Taylor and Travis would mind swapping Chiefs Stadium roars for the best local and national jazz talent.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=bierman-s-christmas-tree-farm><a href=# rel=nofollow>Bierman’s Christmas Tree Farm</a></h3><p>Alexa, play “Christmas Tree Farm” by Taylor Swift. I’m not sure how long #Traylor will last, but if they stick to the cuffing season calendar, they’re on track to make it through the holidays. Bierman’s Christmas Tree Farm is the cutest place for lovers to chop down a tree together to take home.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8uorZ5lo5rFcH2Vbm5wbmdkuKK60pqqZpuZqcZusMCtnGammZy1tXnInZyaq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
