At the time of this interview, Wetzel had barely 10K followers on Twitter. Today he's nearing 300,000. He was quiet — or &#34;efficient,&#34; as host Buddy Logan says — but not unsure of himself or his music."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Today he's nearing 300,000. He was&nbsp;quiet — or "efficient," as host Buddy Logan says — but not unsure of himself or his music. Most notable is the lack of promotion or publicity team. Other artists are his best advocates, and Twitter was where you could score in-studio interviews and performances with this Texas singer. Listen for yourself:</p><p>The Noise Complaint album (2016) was several months&nbsp;old when Wetzel visited with Logan at the Radio Texas, Live! studio. The singer dove into the recording of some of those songs before talking about his influences, some of his favorite music at the time and his family history. Did you know "Koe" is not his legal first name? This early interview catches Wetzel talking about his lineage, where his&nbsp;unusual artist name came from, and more.</p><p>Radio Texas, Live!
