Famed Irish<br>groups Altan and Cherish the Ladies; Eileen Ivers, the nine-time All-Ireland fiddle champion<br>and musical star of Riverdance; National Heritage Award winner Mick Moloney; and All-<br>Ireland Champion multi-instrumentalist and founder of Cherish the Ladies Joanie Madden,<br>have come together, claiming a common outrage at the way they have been treated by one of<br>the major recording companies in world music.</p><p>Green Linnet Records of Danbury, CT has been a leading force in recording and<br>distributing Celtic music for over 25 years. Along with its Xenophile and Redbird labels, the<br>company has over 300 masters licensed and features a roster that has included, among<br>others, Eileen Ivers, Cherish the Ladies, Mick Moloney, Altan, Lunasa, Martin Hayes and<br>Denis Cahill, Tarika, Sharon Shannon, Patrick Street, Phil Cunningham & Aly Bain,<br>Wolfstone, Tommy Sands, the Bothy Band, Jez Lowe, Liz Carroll, Jimmy Keane Robbie<br>O'Connell and the Kennedys.</p><p>In a statement by the plaintiffs, "owner Wendy Newton has been quoted to say, 'We<br>certainly have the best profile of any Celtic label, because we not only release the records, we<br>actively sell and promote them.' And, indeed the rapid expansion of the company and their<br>high-profile role as the major sponsor of the hugely popular NPR syndicated show Thistle and<br>Shamrock was a barometer of their success."</p><p>"It would probably shock most Irish music fans to know that the artists who recorded<br>their favorite Green Linnet albums have not been paid," said Ivers.</p><p>The lawsuit recently filed<br>by the artists (who irreverently refer to themselves as "The Green Linnet Five") highlights the<br>fact that "Green Linnet has consistently failed and refused to provide timely accountings or<br>royalty statements to their artists for several years despite repeated requests and demands;<br>that the company underpays and fails to report income regarding the commercial exploitation<br>of the artist's master recordings; that they improperly reduced the rate of royalties due and<br>inappropriately applied deductions without a contractual basis to do so and to everyone's<br>amazement has the unfettered gall to continue to commercially exploit master recordings for<br>years after the licensing agreements for these albums expired. Additionally the company fails<br>to list income and pay royalties on a number of compilation albums that contain recordings<br>from the artists."</p><p>According to their attorney, Bob Donnelly, "The Green Linnet Five are simply demanding<br>that Green Linnet's numerous and continued breaches of contract warrant full payment of<br>royalties owed, a return of their master recordings and an immediate cessation of exploiting<br>the artists' work."</p><p>Plaintiff Madden pointed out that "we tried to negotiate with them for a year. Ultimately<br>we realized that they had no intention of bargaining in good faith or paying us."</p><p>One of the biggest sources of outrage against the label concerns the issuing of close to<br>100 CD compilations of existing artists' recordings over the last decade. The plaintiffs said<br>"this appeared to be a cynical ploy to exploit the world-wide popularity of Celtic Music in the<br>1990s at little or no cost to the company. Green Linnet issued scores of budget priced albums<br>with the title 'Celtic' and then decided unilaterally that no royalties would be payable to the<br>artists on their sales. It is believed that these compilations ended up selling hundreds of<br>thousands of copies, though the exact figures are unknown to the artists because Green Linnet<br>has refused to account for them except for a few statements which Madden characterized as<br>woefully incomplete."</p><p>The plaintiffs use the case of the world famous Irish group Altan as a good illustration of<br>the case presented by them. They note that Altan were contracted to Green Linnet for a five<br>record deal 1987-1993. Green Linnet admits to owing Altan a figure in excess of $100,000<br>in unpaid artist and publishing royalties. Almost unbelievably Green Linnet refuses to respond<br>to requests for sales records, invoices or other back-up information. As a result, the members<br>of Altan are uncertain of how much they are truly owed.</p><p>The plaintiffs stated "on a number of occasions since 1997, Altan has sought to negotiate<br>monthly payments from Green Linnet to clear what was already then a significant backlog in<br>money owed to the band by the record company. However, Green Linnet consistently failed<br>to adhere to the promised repayment schedules while constantly ignoring a large volume of<br>formal requests from Altan's management to resolve the situation.</p><p>"The members of Altan are appalled at the inordinate number of budget priced<br>compilations licensed by Green Linnet to other companies that feature their work. There are<br>over 75 albums listed on Green Linnet imprints alone that feature Altan tracks. Green Linnet<br>has licensed additional Altan material to other labels for various unauthorized<br>compilations."</p><p>In promotional materials Green Linnet states that "Eileen Ivers is an Irish-American<br>treasure. Among the foremost fiddlers of her generation, she has expanded the boundaries of<br>traditional Celtic music throughout her illustrious career." However, the plaintiffs note that<br>while Green Linnet may regard her as a treasure, the company has steadfastly refused to pay<br>any of the treasure it has earned from the sales of her records. Like her fellow artists, Ivers<br>believes that the $65,000 in royalties which Green Linnet acknowledges that it owes to her, is<br>only a small portion of the true amounts that are due and owing.</p><p>The plaintiffs point out that Green Linnet's most recent violation concerns the<br>blockbuster, award-winning movie Gangs of New York. They state that MiraMax Films<br>licensed Eileen Ivers' recording "Lament for Staker Wallace" from her Wild Blue album for<br>use in the movie. MiraMax agreed to pay a licensing fee of $15,000 of which $11,250 was<br>legally due to be paid to Ivers. As a showing of their "good faith", company president Wendy<br>Newton promised to pay Ivers the full $15,000. When no payment was made for several<br>months after the release of the film, despite Ivers requests for this money, a probe was<br>launched. Ivers finally established through painstaking investigation that payment had been<br>made directly to the record company. The president of Green Linnet stated through her<br>lawyer that the company had already spent Ivers' money and despite their "good faith"<br>promise, Green Linnet once again refused to pay her.</p><p>"Originally we were content to allow our attorneys to work out these problems and not<br>speak about these issues in public," Ivers stated. "But this act of deception was the final straw<br>that broke this camel's back. Now we want the world to know what they are getting when<br>they buy a Green Linnet record. If we can save even one more artist from making the mistake<br>of signing with this company, this will all be worthwhile."</p><p>Ivers has gone on to form her own internationally distributed record label called Musical<br>Bridge Records.</p><p>According to the plaintiffs, over 35 known compilation albums contain Ivers tracks from<br>her Green Linnet recordings. Adding insult to injury, the plaintiffs note that Green Linnet took<br>the unprecedented step of issuing or licensing two greatest hits-type albums despite the fact<br>that Green Linnet only had two Ivers albums to begin with.</p><p>Ivers complained, "I feel like my fans may have been deceived into thinking that they<br>were getting new albums from me ….when all that Green Linnet did was to recycle old<br>material."</p><p>The plaintiffs state that Green Linnet has yet to account for and pay licensing fees and<br>royalties to Ivers for these recordings, and note that Green Linnet admits to owing an<br>estimated $65,000 dollars to Ivers but refuses to pay.</p><p>"It's been years since Green Linnet has sent any royalties for my solo album, four Cherish<br>the Ladies albums, or countless compilations that they've placed us on." says plaintiff Joanie<br>Madden, whose Cherish the Ladies group is the only all-woman, full-time touring group in<br>Celtic Music.</p><p>The plaintiffs note that Green Linnet stated in their promotional materials that, "Over the<br>last 10 years, Cherish the Ladies have become one of the premier Irish traditional groups in<br>the world, and their recordings are always among Green Linnet's top sellers." The<br>plaintiffs also point out that Green Linnet acknowledges that it owes Cherish the Ladies and<br>Joanie Madden over $70,000 dollars in unpaid royalties, although Madden believes that "this<br>is just the tip of the iceberg."</p><p>Plaintiff Moloney is a National Heritage Award winner – the highest honor a traditional<br>artist can receive in the United States. He has performed on and produced over 75 albums of<br>Irish traditional music. Many have been on the Green Linnet label including recordings of the<br>famed group The Green Fields of America, Eileen Ivers and the distinguished musician and<br>composer Seamus Egan. The plaintiffs state that he and the other artists in The Green Fields<br>of America presented complaints against Green Linnet similar to Altan, Cherish the Ladies<br>and Ivers – unauthorized use of recordings for compilations and failure to supply accurate<br>sales figures and to pay royalties owed.</p><p>The plaintiffs state that "Green Linnet seems indifferent to the fact that is going down in<br>infamy as a company which has in effect declared war on its artists, losing no opportunity to<br>mistreat and exploit them at every opportunity. Sadly, Green Linnet and its ownership<br>represent an anomaly in the world of contemporary recorded music; a throwback to the bad<br>old days before reform of the industry when many record companies routinely cheated their<br>artists.</p><p>Plaintiffs' attorney Bob Donnelly said that he was approached by the folk music division<br>of the musician's union to represent 25 other artist who have also not received the royalties to<br>which they are rightfully entitled.</p><p>"I wish I could fight for all of them but I just don't have the time," Donnelly said. "One can<br>only imagine how many other artists are out there who have simply given up. I hope our<br>lawsuit gives them the courage to persevere."</p><p>The plaintiff's state, "It would appear that the ownership and management of Green<br>Linnet have felt secure in mistreating their artists because historically folk and traditional<br>musicians have not possessed the resources to take legal action against major corporations.<br>What Green Linnet clearly did not anticipate is that so many distinguished artists would come<br>together to take collective action against them."</p><p>Moloney summed it up by saying, "In recent years the management of Green Linnet has<br>come up with a typical rejoinder when confronted by artists demanding justice.<br>'Sue us', they say. Well it's finally happened." –edited by Jane Cohen and Bob Grossweiner</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaJuRlr%2BktMivnGifopqyr3nLoqWnnaRis6rCxGatrGWXp7KmuoyloKemlal6s7HCqKmdq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
