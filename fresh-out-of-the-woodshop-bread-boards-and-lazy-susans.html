We wanted a kitchen accessory that would be beautiful and functional for many occasions. That's how we dreamed up the Scotsman Co. Lazy Susans and Bread Boards.</p><p>Each Lazy Susan, or turntable, is a sturdy base and top that spins on its diameter. It's designed to rotate on a set of bearings and sit on a table or countertop to distribute food efficiently. Still, it can also create accessibility for storage in the kitchen.</p><p>Josh Nowell says, "I don't know what Susan did to get this reputation of being lazy. I mean, what about like a Lazy Linda? Regardless, these are great. If I were to put one of these Lazy Susans in our house, my boys would spin on them. The good news is that we built them so well that they could spin without any trouble."</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Screen_Shot_2022-07-22_at_3.41.45_PM.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Maple Lazy Susan</span></a></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>We've created the new Lazy Susans from three different wood species—</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Cherry, Maple, and Walnut.&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Each piece is made from American Hardwoods and will vary in grain pattern and color.

Bread Boards to the mix, and these are a favorite amongst our team, especially Aly Smith. You probably remember her family's&nbsp;<a href=# class=editor-rtfLink rel="noopener noreferrer">Italianate House</a>&nbsp;from Season 2 of&nbsp;Home Town. &nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/491A1138_jpg.webp?v=1658524549" alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Aly's board collection is coveted amongst our team, and her favorite part is displaying her prized possessions on her wall for decor and functionality.</p><p>She says, "I have a wall full of boards of all different sizes, and it is one of my favorite corners in the house. The best part is that I can use these boards in different ways, and easily pull them down from the wall. Our breadboards are so easy to serve on."&nbsp;</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Screen_Shot_2022-07-22_at_3.41.19_PM.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Maple Bread Board</a></p><p>Each breadboard is designed to match your needs. It's lightweight and easy to transport with its handle(s).</p><p>Aly loves to use the Scotsman Co. Bread Board as a charcuterie or serving plate for meats and cheeses at parties or small get-togethers.</p><p>She says, "Honestly, I love using it for parties and then using it as a showpiece just as much on my wall. It serves for function and beauty."</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Screen_Shot_2022-07-22_at_3.40.25_PM.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Walnut Bread Boards</a></p><p>Want to see more of our Scotsman Wood Products?
